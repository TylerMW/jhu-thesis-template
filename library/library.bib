abstract = {Water molecules confined to nonpolar pores and cavities of nanoscopic dimensions exhibit highly unusual properties. Water filling is strongly cooperative, with the possible coexistence of filled and empty states and sensitivity to small perturbations of the pore polarity and solvent conditions. Confined water molecules form tightly hydrogen-bonded wires or clusters. The weak attractions to the confining wall, combined with strong interactions between water molecules, permit exceptionally rapid water flow, exceeding expectations from macroscopic hydrodynamics by several orders of magnitude. The proton mobility along 1D water wires also substantially exceeds that in the bulk. Proteins appear to exploit these unusual properties of confined water in their biological function (e.g., to ensure rapid water flow in aquaporins or to gate proton flow in proton pumps and enzymes). The unusual properties of water in nonpolar confinement are also relevant to the design of novel nanofluidic and molecular separation devices or fuel cells.},

abstract = {Natural materials exhibit anisotropy with variations in soluble factors, cell distribution, and matrix properties. The ability to recreate the heterogeneity of the natural materials is a major challenge for investigating cell-material interactions and for developing biomimetic materials. Here we present a generic fluidic approach using convection and alternating flow to rapidly generate multi-centimeter gradients of biomolecules, polymers, beads and cells and cross-gradients of two species in a microchannel. Accompanying theoretical estimates and simulations of gradient growth provide design criteria over a range of material properties. A poly(ethylene-glycol) hydrogel gradient, a porous collagen gradient and a composite material with a hyaluronic acid/gelatin cross-gradient were generated with continuous variations in material properties and in their ability to regulate cellular response. This simple yet generic fluidic platform should prove useful for creating anisotropic biomimetic materials and high-throughput platforms for investigating cell-microenvironment interactions.},

abstract = {The surface shear viscosity of the liquid expanded phase in Langmuir monolayers of fluorinated alcohols differs by orders of magnitude from the corresponding surface shear viscosity of Langmuir monolayers of their non-fluorinated counterparts. The line tension between the liquid expanded and the gaseous phase on the other hand is of similar magnitude for both fluorinated and non-fluorinated surfactants. The difference of fluorinated versus non-fluorinated monolayers is measured by active microrheology and by observing the shape relaxation of distorted liquid expanded domains toward a circular shape. Our microrheology measurements are supported by measurements of the relaxation rates of distortions, which in fluorinated liquid expanded phases are proportional to the deviation of the curvature from the mean curvature, whereas they are proportional to the square of the deviation of the curvature from the mean curvature in non-fluorinated monolayers.},

abstract = {Hexadecane assimilation by Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus SP17 occurs through the formation of a biofilm at the alkane-water interface. In this study we focused on the interactions of cells with the alkane-water interface occurring during initiation of biofilm development. The behavior of cells at the interface was apprehended by investigating alterations of the mechanical properties of the interface during cell adsorption, using dynamic drop tensiometry measurements. It was found that after having reached the hexadecane-water interface, by a purely thermal diffusion process, cells released surface-active compounds (SACs) resulting in the formation of an interfacial visco-elastic film. Release of SACs was an active process requiring protein synthesis. This initial interaction occurred on metabolizable as well as non-metabolizable alkanes, indicating that at this stage cells are not affected by the nature of the alkane forming the interface. In contrast, at a later stage, the nature of the interface turned out to exert control over the behavior of the cells. The availability of a metabolizable alkane at the interface influenced cell activity, as revealed by cell cluster formation and differences in the interfacial elasticity.},

abstract = {Robust control over the positions, orientations, and assembly of nonspherical colloids may aid in the creation of new types of structured composite materials that are important from both technological and fundamental standpoints. With the use of lithographically fabricated equilateral polygonal platelets, we demonstrate that colloidal interactions and self-assembly in anisotropic nematic fluids can be effectively tailored via control over the particles' shapes. The particles disturb the uniform alignment of the surrounding nematic host, resulting in both a distinct equilibrium alignment and highly directional pair interactions. Interparticle forces between polygonal platelets exhibit either dipolar or quadrupolar symmetries, depending on whether their number of sides is odd or even, and drive the assembly of a number of ensuing self-assembled colloidal structures.},

abstract = {We investigate the surface viscoelasticity of beta-lactoglobulin and beta-casein spread surface monolayers using a recently discovered method. Step compressions are performed, and the surface pressure is measured as a function of time. This is a common experiment for surface monolayers. However in our experiments the pressure is recorded by two perpendicular sensors, parallel and perpendicular to the compression direction. This enables us to clearly measure the time relaxation of both the compression and shear moduli, at the same time, in a single experiment, and with a standard apparatus. beta-Lactoglobulin and beta-casein monolayers are interesting because of their importance in food science and because they exhibit universally slow dynamical behavior that is still not fully understood. Our results confirm that the compressional modulus dominates the total viscoelastic response in both proteins. Indeed for beta-casein we confirm that the shear modulus is always negligible, i.e., the layer is in a fluid state. In beta-lactoglobulin a finite shear modulus emerges above a critical concentration. We emphasize that in Langmuir trough dynamic experiments the surface pressure should be measured in both the compression and the perpendicular directions.},

abstract = {The mechanical properties of biofilms and in particular their mechanical strength is of great importance for both biofilm reactors and for the removal of undesired biofilms as in cases of biofouling and biocorrosion. By uniaxial compression measurements, it is possible to determine the apparent elastic or Young's modulus and the yield stress as parameters for mechanical stability. This was performed with a recently developed device, using model biofilms of mucoid strain Pseudomonas aeruginosa SG81. The biofilms were grown on membrane filters placed on nutrient agar medium with different concentrations of calcium ions. The compressive stress-strain behaviour up to failure was recorded at a compression speed of 1 micron s-1. The apparent Young's modulus, representing the stiffness of the biofilm, and the yield stress obtained from the stress--strain diagram were used for the description of mechanical properties of biofilms. A certain critical concentration of calcium ions was found where the Young's modulus of the P. aeruginosa biofilms increases strongly and subsequently remains constant for higher calcium concentrations. This behaviour is explained by the presence of calcium ions crosslinking alginate, which is the major component of the extracellular polymeric substances produced by the mucoid P. aeruginosa strain used in this investigation.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: In the area of peptide and protein drug products, interfaces are present as part of the basic liquid formulation, when freeze-dried formulations are reconstituted and when particulate delivery systems are prepared. Proteins are known to interact with these interfaces, and the effects seen are often irreversible adsorption and structural changes. AREAS COVERED: This review focuses on the ways in which peptides and proteins interact with surfaces and interfaces, and the effect these interactions have on the stability and safety of the active protein in pharmaceutical formulations. It illustrates, through examples, what can be determined by an adsorption study, and what can change when either the protein or the interfaces are modified. Last but not least, it addresses the value of these studies. The reader will gain an update on the basics of protein adsorption, with a focus on pharmaceutically relevant interfaces and recent advances in the field. EXPERT OPINION: Protein adsorption is widely studied; however, a more unified approach is still needed, especially on the adsorption of pharmaceutically relevant proteins, modified proteins and surfaces.},

abstract = {Microscope images of fluctuating biopolymers contain a wealth of information about their underlying mechanics and dynamics. However, successful extraction of this information requires precise localization of filament position and shape from thousands of noisy images. Here, we present careful measurements of the bending dynamics of filamentous (F-)actin and microtubules at thermal equilibrium with high spatial and temporal resolution using a new, simple but robust, automated image analysis algorithm with subpixel accuracy. We find that slender actin filaments have a persistence length of approximately 17 microm, and display a q(-4)-dependent relaxation spectrum, as expected from viscous drag. Microtubules have a persistence length of several millimeters; interestingly, there is a small correlation between total microtubule length and rigidity, with shorter filaments appearing softer. However, we show that this correlation can arise, in principle, from intrinsic measurement noise that must be carefully considered. The dynamic behavior of the bending of microtubules also appears more complex than that of F-actin, reflecting their higher-order structure. These results emphasize both the power and limitations of light microscopy techniques for studying the mechanics and dynamics of biopolymers.},

abstract = {The adsorption data presented in the preceding paper (Part II of this series) have been used to deduce the molecular structures of $\beta$-casein, bovine serum albumin (BSA), and lysozyme films at the air-water and oil-water interfaces. The hydrophobic, disordered $\beta$-casein molecules are more surface-active than the globular BSA and lysozyme molecules. $\beta$-Casein is in an all-train configuration at low surface pressures ($\pi$ < 8 mN m−1) at the air-water interface and can be described by Singer's equation of state for linear polymers. At higher $\pi$ values, loop formation ensues, and the loops increase in density at the expense of the trains until in the close-packed, condensed state the ratio of amino acid residues in loop and train configurations is about 2:1. This conformational change does not occur at the oil-water interface because loops already form at low $\pi$; enhanced loop formation in the nonaqueous phase is favored because oil molecules solvate the hydrophobic residues. Multilayer formation occurs at high substrate protein concentrations (> 10−2 wt\%) giving films thicker than 100 \AA. Although the primary layer is irreversibly adsorbed, molecules in subsequent layers are reversibly adsorbed. Lysozyme molecules are denatured at low $\pi$ values ($\pi$ < 8 mN m−1), and at higher values essentially native molecules (which are reversibly adsorbed) coexist in the surface film. Much residual native structure remains even in the denatured film because lysozyme is very resistant to denaturation. At the oil-water interface, the adsorbed lysozyme molecules are denatured to a greater extent than those at the air-water interface; native molecules are not stable at this interface. The adsorbed BSA molecules contain residual native structure, but there is no abrupt conformational change in the film at a particular packing density. The structure at the air-water interface is intermediate to those of lysozyme and $\beta$-casein. BSA has the same $\pi$-A curve as lysozyme at the oil-water interface.},

abstract = {The effect of pH on the adsorption of catalase and lysozyme at the air-water interface has been studied using a combined surface pressure-interfacial shear rheology technique. The results presented show that the rate of development of interfacial phenomena increases as the pH of the subphase approaches the isoelectric point of the protein under investigation. The development of the measured interfacial rheological parameters is due to an increased rate of cross-link formation within the resultant interfacial gel. The formation of the interfacial gels has been modeled using a combination of the Smoluchowski theory for the coagulation of an aerosol or fog and classic rubber elasticity theory. The enhanced rate of cross-link formation at the isoelectric point is a result of an in-surface phase separation brought about by cooperative deionization of the protein molecules near their isoelectric point. Simultaneous measurements of surface pressure and interfacial rheology have enabled us to show that the development of a gel-like interfacial network coincides with observed increases in surface pressure.},

abstract = {We investigate the motion of ferromagnetic nanowires confined to nanometer-scale oil films at an air/aqueous interface in response to the application of external magnetic fields and field gradients. By varying the oil viscosity, film thickness, and wire length, we cover two regimes of response suggested by theory: one where the surface viscosity is expected to dominate the wire's motion and one where the subphase viscosity is expected to dominate [Levine, A. J.; Liverpool, T. B.; MacKintosh, F. C. Phys. Rev. E 2004, 69, 021503]. For wire motion parallel to the long axis of the wire, the observed drag agrees reasonably with theoretical predictions. However, the drag on wires moving perpendicular to their long axis or rotating about a short axis is unexpectedly insensitive to the film properties over the full range of measurements. This behavior is in contrast to the rotational and translational drag on nanowires in molecularly thin protein layers, which follow theoretical expectations. The observations in the oil films, which are explained in terms of the manner in which the wire immerses dynamically in the film and subphase, demonstrate how the effective drag viscosity of an aspherical particle confined to a fluid interface can depend on its direction of motion.},

@article{Choi2011,
abstract = {Two-dimensional films of surface-active agents-from phospholipids and proteins to nanoparticles and colloids-stabilize fluid interfaces, which are essential to the science, technology and engineering of everyday life. The 2D nature of interfaces present unique challenges and opportunities: coupling between the 2D films and the bulk fluids complicates the measurement of surface dynamic properties, but allows the interfacial microstructure to be directly visualized during deformation. Here we present a novel technique that combines active microrheology with fluorescence microscopy to visualize fluid interfaces as they deform under applied stress, allowing structure and rheology to be correlated on the micron-scale in monolayer films. We show that even simple, single-component lipid monolayers can exhibit viscoelasticity, history dependence, a yield stress and hours-long time scales for elastic recoil and aging. Simultaneous visualization of the monolayer under stress shows that the rich dynamical response results from the cooperative dynamics and deformation of liquid-crystalline domains and their boundaries.},

However, this approximation has a restricted validity range, and its application to determination of inclusion sizes from diffusion data may in certain cases lead to unreliable results. At the same time, the model by Hughes et al. (Hughes, B. D., B. A. Pailthorpe, and C. R. White. 1981. J. Fluid Mech. 110:349-372.), providing diffusion coefficients of membrane inclusions for arbitrary inclusion sizes and viscosities of the membrane and surrounding fluids, involves substantial computational efforts, which prevents its use in practical data analysis. We develop a simple and accurate analytical approximation to the Hughes et al. model and demonstrate its performance and utility by applying it to the recently published experimental data on translational diffusion of micrometer-sized membrane domains.},

abstract = {Employing frequency-dependent dielectric susceptibility we characterize the aging in two supercooled liquids, sorbitol and xylitol, below their calorimetric glass transition temperatures. In addition to the alpha relaxation that tracks the structural dynamics, the susceptibility of both liquids possesses a secondary Johari-Goldstein relaxation at higher frequencies. Following a quench through the glass transition, the susceptibility slowly approaches the equilibrium behavior. For both liquids, the magnitude of the Johari-Goldstein relaxation displays a dependence on the time since the quench, or aging time, that is quantitatively very similar to the age dependence of the alpha peak frequency. The Johari-Goldstein relaxation time remains constant during aging for sorbitol while it decreases slightly with age for xylitol. Hence, one cannot sensibly assign a fictive temperature to the Johari-Goldstein relaxation. This behavior contrasts with that of liquids lacking distinct Johari-Goldstein peaks for which the excess wing of the alpha peak tracks the main part of the peak during aging, enabling the assignment of a single fictive temperature to the entire spectrum. The aging behavior of the Johari-Goldstein relaxation time further calls into question the possibility that the relaxation time possesses stronger temperature dependence in equilibrium than is observed in the out-of-equilibrium state below the glass transition.},

@article{Yampolskaya2006,
abstract = {A review in which many original published results of the authors as well as many other papers are discussed. The structure and some properties of the globular proteins are shortly presented, special accent being put on the alpha-chymotrypsin (alpha-ChT), lysozyme (LZ), human serum albumin (HSA), and bovine serum albumin (BSA) which have been used in the experiments with thin liquid films. The behaviour of protein adsorption layers (PAL) is extensively discussed. The dynamics of PAL formation, including the kinetics of adsorption as well as the time evolution of the surface tension of protein aqueous solutions, are considered. A considerable place is devoted to the surface tension and adsorption isotherms of the globular protein solutions, the simulation of PAL by interacting hard spheres, the experimental surface tension isotherms of the above mentioned proteins, and the interfacial tension isotherms for the protein aqueous solution/oil interface. The rheological properties of PAL at fluid interfaces are shortly reviewed. After a brief information about the experimental methods for investigation of protein thin liquid (foam or emulsion) films, the properties of the protein black foam films are extensively discussed: the conditions for their formation, the influence of the electrolytes and pH on the film type and stability, the thermodynamic properties of the black foam films, the contact angles film/bulk and their dynamic hysteresis. The next center of attention concerns some properties of the protein emulsion films: the conditions for formation of emulsion black films, the formation and development of a dimpling in microscopic, circular films. The protein-phospholipid mixed foam films are also briefly considered.},

The interplay between the two strands operates at many scales: themes which have already benefited from it include the possible role of mantle plumes in the breakup of Gondwana, the Cenozoic development of drainage systems in Africa and Australia, Himalayan uplift in response to erosion, alternating episodes of uplift and subsidence in the Mississippi delta, buckling of the Indian lithospheric plate, and changes in stream pattern and sinuosity along individual alluvial channels subject to localized deformation. Developments in remote sensing, isotopic dating and numerical modelling are starting to yield quantitative analyses of such effects, to the benefit of geodymamics as well as fluvial hydrology.},

abstract = {A theoretical description of the shape of a random object is presented that is analytically simple in application but quantitatively accurate. The asymmetry of the object is characterized in terms of the invariants of a tensor, analogous to the moment-of-inertia tensor, whose eigenvalues are the squares of the principal radii of gyration. The complications accompanying ensemble averaging because of random processes are greatly reduced when the object is embedded in a space of high dimensionality, d. Exact analytical expressions are presented in the case of infinite spatial dimensions, and a procedure for developing an expansion in powers of l/d is discussed for linear chain and ring-type random walks. The first two terms in such an expansion lead to results for various shape parameters that agree remarkably well with those calculated by computer simulation. The method can be extended to yield an approximate, but extremely accurate, expression for the probability distribution function directly. The theoretical approach discussed here can, in principle, be used to describe the shape of other random fractal objects as well.},

abstract = {Liquid water consistently expands our appreciation of the rich statistical mechanics that can emerge from simple molecular constituents. Here I review several interrelated areas of recent work on aqueous systems that aim to explore and explain this richness by revealing molecular arrangements, their thermodynamic origins, and the timescales on which they change. Vibrational spectroscopy of OH stretching features prominently in these discussions, with an emphasis on efforts to establish connections between spectroscopic signals and statistics of intermolecular structure. For bulk solutions, the results of these efforts largely verify and enrich existing physical pictures of hydrogen-bond network connectivity, dynamics, and response. For water at interfaces, such pictures are still emerging. As an important example I discuss the solvation of small ions at the air-water interface, whose surface propensities challenge a basic understanding of how aqueous fluctuations accommodate solutes in heterogeneous environments.},

Strikingly, a large enough particle in contractile fluid (such as an actomyosin gel) can show negative viscous drag in steady state: the particle moves in the opposite direction to the externally applied force. We explain this, and the qualitative trends seen in our simulations, in terms of the disruption of orientational order around the probe particle and the resulting modifications to the active stress.},

To gain an understanding of insulin's aggregation mechanism in aqueous solutions, the effects of agitation rate, interfacial interactions, and insulin concentration on the overall aggregation rate were examined. Ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy, high-performance liquid chromatography, and quasielastic light scattering analyses were used to monitor the aggregation reaction and identify intermediate species. The reaction proceeded in two stages; insulin stability was enhanced at higher concentration. Mathematical modeling of proposed kinetic schemes was employed to identify possible reaction pathways and to explain greater stability at higher insulin concentration.},

The catalytic activity of the rods on a hydrogen peroxide aqueous subphase gives rise to anomalous translational and rotational diffusion. The rods perform a Levy-walk superdiffusive motion that can be decomposed into thermal orientation fluctuations and an active motion of the rods with a constant velocity along their long axis. Since interfacial dissipation increases relative to bulk phase dissipation when miniaturizing the size of objects moving in the interface, the autonomous nanorods allow for precise measurements of surface shear viscosities as low as a few nN s/m. The cross over from active motion toward passive diffusion when increasing the surfactant concentration is explained by a loss of friction asymmetry of the rods.},

abstract = {Glasses are disordered materials that lack the periodicity of crystals but behave mechanically like solids. The most common way of making a glass is by cooling a viscous liquid fast enough to avoid crystallization. Although this route to the vitreous state-supercooling-has been known for millennia, the molecular processes by which liquids acquire amorphous rigidity upon cooling are not fully understood. Here we discuss current theoretical knowledge of the manner in which intermolecular forces give rise to complex behaviour in supercooled liquids and glasses. An intriguing aspect of this behaviour is the apparent connection between dynamics and thermodynamics. The multidimensional potential energy surface as a function of particle coordinates (the energy landscape) offers a convenient viewpoint for the analysis and interpretation of supercooling and glass-formation phenomena. That much of this analysis is at present largely qualitative reflects the fact that precise computations of how viscous liquids sample their landscape have become possible only recently.},

abstract = {The motion of peritrichously flagellated bacteria close to surfaces is relevant to understanding the early stages of biofilm formation and of pathogenic infection. This motion differs from the random-walk trajectories of cells in free solution. Individual Escherichia coli cells swim in clockwise, circular trajectories near planar glass surfaces. On a semi-solid agar substrate, cells differentiate into an elongated, hyperflagellated phenotype and migrate cooperatively over the surface, a phenomenon called swarming. We have developed a technique for observing isolated E. coli swarmer cells moving on an agar substrate and confined in shallow, oxidized poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) microchannels. Here we show that cells in these microchannels preferentially 'drive on the right', swimming preferentially along the right wall of the microchannel (viewed from behind the moving cell, with the agar on the bottom). We propose that when cells are confined between two interfaces--one an agar gel and the second PDMS--they swim closer to the agar surface than to the PDMS surface (and for much longer periods of time), leading to the preferential movement on the right of the microchannel. Thus, the choice of materials guides the motion of cells in microchannels.},

abstract = {Particle tracking techniques are often used to assess the local mechanical properties of cells and biological fluids. The extracted trajectories are exploited to compute the mean-squared displacement that characterizes the dynamics of the probe particles. Limited spatial resolution and statistical uncertainty are the limiting factors that alter the accuracy of the mean-squared displacement estimation. We precisely quantified the effect of localization errors in the determination of the mean-squared displacement by separating the sources of these errors into two separate contributions. A "static error" arises in the position measurements of immobilized particles. A "dynamic error" comes from the particle motion during the finite exposure time that is required for visualization. We calculated the propagation of these errors on the mean-squared displacement. We examined the impact of our error analysis on theoretical model fluids used in biorheology. These theoretical predictions were verified for purely viscous fluids using simulations and a multiple-particle tracking technique performed with video microscopy. We showed that the static contribution can be confidently corrected in dynamics studies by using static experiments performed at a similar noise-to-signal ratio. This groundwork allowed us to achieve higher resolution in the mean-squared displacement, and thus to increase the accuracy of microrheology studies.},

abstract = {Video-based particle tracking monitors the microscopic movement of labeled biomolecules and fluorescent probes within a complex cellular environment. Information gained from this technique enables us to extract the dynamic behavior of biomolecules and the local mechanical properties inside the cell from a tracked particle's mean-square displacement (MSD). However, MSD measurements are highly susceptible to static error introduced by noise in the image acquisition process that leads to an incorrect positioning of the particle. Static error can mask the subtle effects from the local microenvironment on the MSD and potentially generate misleading conclusions about the biophysical properties of cells. An approach that greatly increases the accuracy of MSD measurements is presented herein by combining experimental data with Monte Carlo simulations to eliminate the inherent static error. This practical method of static error correction greatly advances particle-tracking techniques.},

abstract = {External reflection FTIR spectroscopy and surface pressure measurements were used to compare conformational changes in the adsorbed structures of three globular proteins at the air/water interface. Of the three proteins studied, lysozyme, bovine serum albumin and beta-lactoglobulin, lysozyme was unique in its behaviour. Lysozyme adsorption was slow, taking approximately 2.5 h to reach a surface pressure plateau (from a 0.07 mM solution), and led to significant structural change. The FTIR spectra revealed that lysozyme formed a highly networked adsorbed layer of unfolded protein with high antiparallel beta-sheet content and that these changes occurred rapidly (within 10 min). This non-native secondary structure is analogous to that of a 3D heat-set protein gel, suggesting that the adsorbed protein formed a highly networked interfacial layer. Albumin and beta-lactoglobulin adsorbed rapidly (reaching a plateau within 10 min) and with little change to their native secondary structure.},

abstract = {Although human musical performances represent one of the most valuable achievements of mankind, the best musicians perform imperfectly. Musical rhythms are not entirely accurate and thus inevitably deviate from the ideal beat pattern. Nevertheless, computer generated perfect beat patterns are frequently devalued by listeners due to a perceived lack of human touch. Professional audio editing software therefore offers a humanizing feature which artificially generates rhythmic fluctuations. However, the built-in humanizing units are essentially random number generators producing only simple uncorrelated fluctuations. Here, for the first time, we establish long-range fluctuations as an inevitable natural companion of both simple and complex human rhythmic performances. Moreover, we demonstrate that listeners strongly prefer long-range correlated fluctuations in musical rhythms. Thus, the favorable fluctuation type for humanizing interbeat intervals coincides with the one generically inherent in human musical performances.},

abstract = {It has been widely acknowledged that self-replicating space-probes (SRPs) could explore the galaxy very quickly relative to the age of the galaxy. An obvious implication is that SRPs produced by extraterrestrial civilizations should have arrived in our solar system millions of years ago, and furthermore, that new probes from an ever-arising supply of civilizations ought to be arriving on a constant basis. The lack of observations of such probes underlies a frequently cited variation of the Fermi Paradox. We believe that a predilection for ETI-optimistic theories has deterred consideration of incompatible theories. Notably, SRPs have virtually disappeared from the literature. In this paper, we consider the most common arguments against SRPs and find those arguments lacking. By extension, we find recent models of galactic exploration which explicitly exclude SRPs to be unfairly handicapped and unlikely to represent natural scenarios.   We also consider several other models that seek to explain the Fermi Paradox, most notably percolation theory and two societal-collapse theories. In the former case, we find that it imposes unnatural assumptions which likely render it unrealistic. In the latter case, we present a new theory of interstellar transportation bandwidth which calls into question the validity of societal-collapse theories.   Finally, we offer our thoughts on how to design future SETI programs which take the conclusions of this paper into account to maximize the chance of detection.},

abstract = {Microorganisms such as bacteria and many eukaryotic cells propel themselves with hair-like structures known as flagella, which can exhibit a variety of structures and movement patterns. For example, bacterial flagella are helically shaped and driven at their bases by a reversible rotary engine, which rotates the attached flagellum to give a motion similar to that of a corkscrew. In contrast, eukaryotic cells use flagella that resemble elastic rods and exhibit a beating motion: internally generated stresses give rise to a series of bends that propagate towards the tip. In contrast to this variety of swimming strategies encountered in nature, a controlled swimming motion of artificial micrometre-sized structures has not yet been realized. Here we show that a linear chain of colloidal magnetic particles linked by DNA and attached to a red blood cell can act as a flexible artificial flagellum. The filament aligns with an external uniform magnetic field and is readily actuated by oscillating a transverse field. We find that the actuation induces a beating pattern that propels the structure, and that the external fields can be adjusted to control the velocity and the direction of motion.},

abstract = {Particle tracking techniques are often used to assess the local mechanical properties of cells and biological fluids. The extracted trajectories are exploited to compute the mean-squared displacement that characterizes the dynamics of the probe particles. Limited spatial resolution and statistical uncertainty are the limiting factors that alter the accuracy of the mean-squared displacement estimation. We precisely quantified the effect of localization errors in the determination of the mean-squared displacement by separating the sources of these errors into two separate contributions. A "static error" arises in the position measurements of immobilized particles. A "dynamic error" comes from the particle motion during the finite exposure time that is required for visualization. We calculated the propagation of these errors on the mean-squared displacement. We examined the impact of our error analysis on theoretical model fluids used in biorheology. These theoretical predictions were verified for purely viscous fluids using simulations and a multiple-particle tracking technique performed with video microscopy. We showed that the static contribution can be confidently corrected in dynamics studies by using static experiments performed at a similar noise-to-signal ratio. This groundwork allowed us to achieve higher resolution in the mean-squared displacement, and thus to increase the accuracy of microrheology studies.},

abstract = {The protein hydrophobin HFBII self-assembles into very elastic films at the surface of water; these films wrinkle readily upon compression. We demonstrate and study this wrinkling instability in the context of non-planar interfaces by forming HFBII layers at the surface of bubbles whose interfaces are then compressed by deflation of the bubble. By varying the initial concentration of the hydrophobin solutions, we are able to show that buckling occurs at a critical packing fraction of protein molecules on the surface. Independent experiments show that at this packing fraction the interface has a finite positive surface tension, and not zero surface tension as is usually assumed at buckling. We attribute this non-zero wrinkling tension to the finite elasticity of these interfaces. We develop a simple geometrical model for the evolution of the wrinkle length with further deflation and show that wrinkles grow rapidly near the needle (used for deflation) towards the mid-plane of the bubble. This geometrical model yields predictions for the length of wrinkles in good agreement with experiments independently of the rheological properties of the adsorbed layer.},

Unfortunately, existing viscosity models, such as the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann (VFT) and Avramov-Milchev (AM) equations, exhibit systematic error when extrapolating to low temperatures. We present a model offering an improved description of the viscosity-temperature relationship for both inorganic and organic liquids using the same number of parameters as VFT and AM. The model has a clear physical foundation based on the temperature dependence of configurational entropy, and it offers an accurate prediction of low-temperature isokoms without any singularity at finite temperature. Our results cast doubt on the existence of a Kauzmann entropy catastrophe and associated ideal glass transition.},

abstract = {Thin liquid films, such as soap bubbles, have been studied extensively for over a century because they are easily formed and mediate a wide range of transport processes in physics, chemistry and engineering. When a bubble on a liquid-gas or solid-gas interface (referred to herein as an interfacial bubble) ruptures, the general expectation is that the bubble vanishes. More precisely, the ruptured thin film is expected to retract rapidly until it becomes part of the interface, an event that typically occurs within milliseconds. The assumption that ruptured bubbles vanish is central to theories on foam evolution and relevant to health and climate because bubble rupture is a source for aerosol droplets. Here we show that for a large range of fluid parameters, interfacial bubbles can create numerous small bubbles when they rupture, rather than vanishing. We demonstrate, both experimentally and numerically, that the curved film of the ruptured bubble can fold and entrap air as it retracts. The resulting toroidal geometry of the trapped air is unstable, leading to the creation of a ring of smaller bubbles. The higher pressure associated with the higher curvature of the smaller bubbles increases the absorption of gas into the liquid, and increases the efficiency of rupture-induced aerosol dispersal.},

abstract = {As our knowledge of biological processes advances, we are increasingly aware that cells actively position sub-cellular organelles and other constituents to control a wide range of biological processes. Many studies quantify the position and motion of, for example, fluorescently labeled proteins, protein aggregates, mRNA particles or virus particles. Both differential interference contrast (DIC) and fluorescence microscopy can visualize vesicles, nuclei or other small organelles moving inside cells. While such studies are increasingly important, there has been no complete analysis of the different tracking methods in use, especially from the practical point of view. Here we investigate these methods and clarify how well different algorithms work and also which factors play a role in assessing how accurately the position of an object can be determined. Specifically, we consider how ultimate performance is affected by magnification, by camera type (analog versus digital), by recording medium (VHS and SVHS tape versus direct tracking from camera), by image compression, by type of imaging used (fluorescence versus DIC images) and by a variety of sources of noise. We show that most methods are capable of nanometer scale accuracy under realistic conditions; tracking accuracy decreases with increasing noise. Surprisingly, accuracy is found to be insensitive to the numerical aperture, but, as expected, it scales with magnification, with higher magnification yielding improved accuracy (within limits of signal-to-noise). When noise is present at reasonable levels, the effect of image compression is in most cases small. Finally, we provide a free, robust implementation of a tracking algorithm that is easily downloaded and installed.},

Aiming to perform an objective comparison of methods, we gathered the community and organized an open competition in which participating teams applied their own methods independently to a commonly defined data set including diverse scenarios. Performance was assessed using commonly defined measures. Although no single method performed best across all scenarios, the results revealed clear differences between the various approaches, leading to notable practical conclusions for users and developers.},

@article{Braun2011,
abstract = {The cyclic tetrapyrroles, viz. chlorophylls (Chl), their bacterial analogs bacteriochlorophylls, and hemes are ubiquitous cofactors of biological catalysis that are involved in a multitude of reactions. One systematic approach for understanding how Nature achieves functional diversity with only this handful of cofactors is by designing de novo simple and robust protein scaffolds with heme and/or (bacterio)chlorophyll [(B)Chls]-binding sites. This strategy is currently mostly implemented for heme-binding proteins. To gain more insight into the factors that determine heme-/(B)Chl-binding selectivity, we explored the geometric parameters of (B)Chl-binding sites in a nonredundant subset of natural (B)Chl protein structures. Comparing our analysis to the study of a nonredundant database of heme-binding helical histidines by Negron et al. (Proteins 2009;74:400-416), we found a preference for the m-rotamer in (B)Chl-binding helical histidines, in contrast to the preferred t-rotamer in heme-binding helical histidines. This may be used for the design of specific heme- or (B)Chl-binding sites in water-soluble helical bundles, because the rotamer type defines the positioning of the bound cofactor with respect to the helix interface and thus the protein-binding site. Consensus sequences for (B)Chl binding were identified by combining a computational and database-derived approach and shown to be significantly different from the consensus sequences recommended by Negron et al. (Proteins 2009;74:400-416) for heme-binding helical proteins. The insights gained in this work on helix- (B)Chls-binding pockets provide useful guidelines for the construction of reasonable (B)Chl-binding protein templates that can be optimized by computational tools.},

We have measured these forces using magnetic nanowires. The torque on a wire and its orientation-dependent repulsion from a flat surface are quantitatively consistent with theoretical predictions based on the elastic properties of the liquid crystal. These forces can also be used to manipulate submicrometer-scale particles. We show that controlled spatial variations in the liquid crystal's alignment convert the torque on a wire to a translational force that levitates the wire to a specified height.},

abstract = {Most bacteria live in the form of adherent communities forming three-dimensional material anchored to artificial or biological surfaces, with profound impact on many human activities. Biofilms are recognized as complex systems but their physical properties have been mainly studied from a macroscopic perspective. To determine biofilm local mechanical properties, reveal their potential heterogeneity, and investigate their relation to molecular traits, we have developed a seemingly new microrheology approach based on magnetic particle infiltration in growing biofilms. Using magnetic tweezers, we achieved what was, to our knowledge, the first three-dimensional mapping of the viscoelastic parameters on biofilms formed by the bacterium Escherichia coli. We demonstrate that its mechanical profile may exhibit elastic compliance values spread over three orders of magnitude in a given biofilm. We also prove that heterogeneity strongly depends on external conditions such as growth shear stress. Using strains genetically engineered to produce well-characterized cell surface adhesins, we show that the mechanical profile of biofilm is exquisitely sensitive to the expression of different surface appendages such as F pilus or curli. These results provide a quantitative view of local mechanical properties within intact biofilms and open up an additional avenue for elucidating the emergence and fate of the different microenvironments within these living materials.},

abstract = {Many segmentation algorithms in medical imaging rely on accurate modeling and estimation of tissue intensity probability density functions. Gaussian mixture modeling, currently the most common approach, has several drawbacks, such as reliance on a Gaussian model and iterative local optimization used to estimate the model parameters. It also does not take advantage of substantially larger amount of data provided by 3D acquisitions, which are becoming standard in clinical environment. We propose a novel and completely non-parametric algorithm to estimate the tissue intensity probabilities in 3D images. Instead of relying on traditional framework of iterating between classification and estimation, we pose the problem as an instance of a blind source separation problem, where the unknown distributions are treated as sources and histograms of image subvolumes as mixtures. The new approach performed well on synthetic data and real magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the brain, robustly capturing intensity distributions of even small image structures and partial volume voxels.},

abstract = {A review of the structure and some properties of condensed phases of water is given. Since the discovery of the polymorphism of crystalline ice (beginning of the twentieth century), 15 ice modifications have been found and their structures have been determined. If we do not take into consideration proton ordering or disordering, nine distinct crystalline ice modifications in which water molecules retain their individuality are known. In the tenth, ice X, there are no H(2)O molecules. It contains ions (or atoms) of oxygen and hydrogen. The structure of all these modifications is described and information about their fields of stability and about the transition between them is given. It is emphasized that there are ice modifications which are metastable at any temperature and pressure (ices Ic, IV and XII), and many modifications can exist as metastable phases beyond their fields of stability. The ability of water to exist in metastable states is one of its remarkable properties. Several amorphous ice modifications (all of them are metastable) are known. Brief information about their properties and transitions between them is given. At the end of the 1960s the conception of the water structure as a three-dimensional hydrogen-bonded network was conclusively formed. Discovery of the polymorphism of amorphous ices awakened interest in the heterogeneity of the water network. Structural and dynamical heterogeneity of liquid water is discussed in detail. Computer simulation showed that the diffusion coefficient of water molecules in dense regions of the network is lower than in the loose regions, while an increase of density of the entire network gives rise to an increase of diffusion coefficient. This finding contradicts the conceptions associated with the primitive two-state models and can be explained from pressure dependences of melting temperature and of homogeneous nucleation temperature. A brief discussion of the picture of molecular motions in liquid water based on experiment and on computer simulation is given. This picture is still very incomplete. The most fascinating idea that was put forward during the last 20 years was the second critical point conjecture. It is still not clear whether this conjecture corresponds to reality.},

But in disordered systems anomalous diffusion may occur, in which the mean-square displacement is proportional to some other power of time. In the presence of moderate concentrations of obstacles, diffusion is anomalous over short distances and normal over long distances. Monte Carlo calculations are used to characterize anomalous diffusion for obstacle concentrations between zero and the percolation threshold. As the obstacle concentration approaches the percolation threshold, diffusion becomes more anomalous over longer distances; the anomalous diffusion exponent and the crossover length both increase. The crossover length and time show whether anomalous diffusion can be observed in a given experiment.},

The fluids are highly viscous to replicate the low Reynolds number environment of microorganisms. The helix, a macroscopic scale model for the bacterial flagellar filament, is rigid and rotated at a constant rate while simultaneously translated along its axis. By adjusting the translation speed to make the net hydrodynamic force vanish, we measure the force-free swimming speed as a function of helix rotation rate, helix geometry, and fluid properties. We compare our measurements of the force-free swimming speed of a helix in a high-molecular weight silicone oil with predictions for the swimming speed in a Newtonian fluid, calculated using slender-body theories and a boundary-element method. The excellent agreement between theory and experiment in the Newtonian case verifies the high accuracy of our experiments. For the viscoelastic fluid, we use a polymer solution of polyisobutylene dissolved in polybutene. This solution is a Boger fluid, a viscoselastic fluid with a shear-rate-independent viscosity. The elasticity is dominated by a single relaxation time. When the relaxation time is short compared to the rotation period, the viscoelastic swimming speed is close to the viscous swimming speed. As the relaxation time increases, the viscoelastic swimming speed increases relative to the viscous speed, reaching a peak when the relaxation time is comparable to the rotation period. As the relaxation time is further increased, the viscoelastic swimming speed decreases and eventually falls below the viscous swimming speed.},

abstract = {Brownian motion influences bacterial swimming by randomizing displacement and direction. Here, we report that the influence of Brownian motion is amplified when it is coupled to hydrodynamic interaction. We examine swimming trajectories of the singly flagellated bacterium Caulobacter crescentus near a glass surface with total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and observe large fluctuations over time in the distance of the cell from the solid surface caused by Brownian motion. The observation is compared with computer simulation based on analysis of relevant physical factors, including electrostatics, van der Waals force, hydrodynamics, and Brownian motion. The simulation reproduces the experimental findings and reveals contribution from fluctuations of the cell orientation beyond the resolution of present observation. Coupled with hydrodynamic interaction between the bacterium and the boundary surface, the fluctuations in distance and orientation subsequently lead to variation of the swimming speed and local radius of curvature of swimming trajectory. These results shed light on the fundamental roles of Brownian motion in microbial motility, nutrient uptake, and adhesion.},

@article{Malcolm2006,
abstract = {We present the first characterization of the mechanical properties of lysozyme films formed by self-assembly at the air-water interface using the Cambridge interfacial tensiometer (CIT), an apparatus capable of subjecting protein films to a much higher level of extensional strain than traditional dilatational techniques. CIT analysis, which is insensitive to surface pressure, provides a direct measure of the extensional stress-strain behavior of an interfacial film without the need to assume a mechanical model (e.g., viscoelastic), and without requiring difficult-to-test assumptions regarding low-strain material linearity. This testing method has revealed that the bulk solution pH from which assembly of an interfacial lysozyme film occurs influences the mechanical properties of the film more significantly than is suggested by the observed differences in elastic moduli or surface pressure. We have also identified a previously undescribed pH dependency in the effect of solution ionic strength on the mechanical strength of the lysozyme films formed at the air-water interface. Increasing solution ionic strength was found to increase lysozyme film strength when assembly occurred at pH 7, but it caused a decrease in film strength at pH 11, close to the pI of lysozyme. This result is discussed in terms of the significant contribution made to protein film strength by both electrostatic interactions and the hydrophobic effect. Washout experiments to remove protein from the bulk phase have shown that a small percentage of the interfacially adsorbed lysozyme molecules are reversibly adsorbed. Finally, the washout tests have probed the role played by additional adsorption to the fresh interface formed by the application of a large strain to the lysozyme film and have suggested the movement of reversibly bound lysozyme molecules from a subinterfacial layer to the interface.},

abstract = {Recent studies have shown that high levels of speech understanding could be achieved when the speech spectrum was divided into four channels and then reconstructed as a sum of four noise bands or sine waves with frequencies equal to the center frequencies of the channels. In these studies speech understanding was assessed using sentences produced by a single male talker. The aim of experiment 1 was to assess the number of channels necessary for a high level of speech understanding when sentences were produced by multiple talkers. In experiment 1, sentences produced by 135 different talkers were processed through n (2n16) number of channels, synthesized as a sum of n sine waves with frequencies equal to the center frequencies of the filters, and presented to normal-hearing listeners for identification. A minimum of five channels was needed to achieve a high level 90\% of speech understanding. Asymptotic performance was achieved with eight channels, at least for the speech material used in this study. The outcome of experiment 1 demonstrated that the number of channels needed to reach asymptotic performance varies as a function of the recognition task and/or need for listeners to attend to fine phonetic detail. In experiment 2, sentences were processed through 6 and 16 channels and quantized into a small number of steps. The purpose of this experiment was to investigate whether listeners use across-channel differences in amplitude to code frequency information, particularly when speech is processed through a small number of channels. For sentences processed through six channels there was a significant reduction in speech understanding when the spectral amplitudes were quantized into a small number 8 of steps. High levels 92\% of speech understanding were maintained for sentences processed through 16 channels and quantized into only 2 steps. The findings of experiment 2 suggest an inverse relationship between the importance of spectral amplitude resolution number of steps and spectral resolution number of channels.},

Laboratory observations indicate that biofilms are viscoelastic materials. Likewise, current knowledge of biofilm internal structure suggests modeling biofilms as associated polymer viscoelastic systems. Supporting experimental results and a system of viscoelastic fluid equations with a linear Jeffreys viscoelastic stress-strain law are presented here. This system of equations is based on elements of associated polymer physics and is also consistent with presented and previous experimental results. A number of predictions can be made. One particularly interesting result is the prediction of an elastic relaxation time on the order of a few minutes-biofilm disturbances on shorter time scales produce an elastic response, biofilm disturbances on longer time scales result in viscous flow, i.e., nonreversible biofilm deformation. Although not previously recognized, evidence of this phenomenon is in fact present in recent experimental results.},

abstract = {In this study, the mobility of nanoparticles in mucus and similar hydrogels as model systems was assessed to elucidate the link between microscopic diffusion behavior and macroscopic penetration of such gels. Differences in particle adhesion to mucus components were strongly dependent on particle coating. Particles coated with 2 kDa PEG exhibited a decreased adhesion to mucus components, whereas chitosan strongly increased the adhesion. Despite such mucoinert properties of PEG, magnetic nanoparticles of both coatings did not penetrate through native respiratory mucus, resisting high magnetic forces (even for several hours). However, model hydrogels were, indeed, penetrated by both particles in dependency of particle coating, obeying the theory of particle mobility in an external force field. Comparison of penetration data with cryogenic scanning EM images of mucus and the applied model systems suggested particularly high rigidity of the mucin scaffold and a broad pore size distribution in mucus as reasons for the observed particle immobilization. Active probing of the rigidity of mucus and model gels with optical tweezers was used in this context to confirm such properties of mucus on the microscale, thus presenting the missing link between micro- and macroscopical observations. Because of high heterogeneity in the size of the voids and pores in mucus, on small scales, particle mobility will depend on adhesive or inert properties. However, particle translocation over distances larger than a few micrometers is restricted by highly rigid structures within the mucus mesh.},

Estimates are provided of probabilities of failure during typical use (which includes both incorrect and inconsistent use) and during perfect use (correct and consistent use). The difference between these two probabilities reveals the consequences of imperfect use; it depends both on how unforgiving of imperfect use a method is and on how hard it is to use that method perfectly. These revisions reflect new research on contraceptive failure both during perfect use and during typical use.},

As all its intervals are equal, the blend of intervals is the same in every key, so all keys sound alike. “Key colour” is a feature of temperaments with unequal intervals, like Meantone and Well Temper. Before equal temperament came along in the mid 19th century, “Key Colour” - also known as “Key Character”, or, in German, “Affekt” - was a familiar and generally accepted part of musi- cal expression. By Beethoven’s day, the concept of “Key Character” (in which different keys conveyed specific emotional meanings), was much refined. A widely read and influential list of keys and their affective qualities, written by Christian Friedrich Daniel Schubart and published posthumously in 1806, contained the fashionable descriptions for all major and minor keys.” from “The Well-Tempered Piano” by Edward Foote.},

The time dependence of the density profile at the air/water interface revealed that the molecular conformation changed significantly during adsorption. Taking into account previous work using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, we propose that the LSZ molecules initially adsorbed on the air/water interface have a flat unfolded structure, forming antiparallel beta-sheets as a result of hydrophobic interactions with the gas phase. In contrast, as adsorption continues, a second layer forms in which the molecules have a very loose structure having random coils as a result of hydrophilic interactions with the hydrophilic groups that protrude from the first layer.},

abstract = {External reflection FTIR spectroscopy and surface pressure measurements were used to compare conformational changes in the adsorbed structures of three globular proteins at the air/water interface. Of the three proteins studied, lysozyme, bovine serum albumin and beta-lactoglobulin, lysozyme was unique in its behaviour. Lysozyme adsorption was slow, taking approximately 2.5 h to reach a surface pressure plateau (from a 0.07 mM solution), and led to significant structural change. The FTIR spectra revealed that lysozyme formed a highly networked adsorbed layer of unfolded protein with high antiparallel beta-sheet content and that these changes occurred rapidly (within 10 min). This non-native secondary structure is analogous to that of a 3D heat-set protein gel, suggesting that the adsorbed protein formed a highly networked interfacial layer. Albumin and beta-lactoglobulin adsorbed rapidly (reaching a plateau within 10 min) and with little change to their native secondary structure.},

abstract = {We present a method for performing multiple single-molecule manipulation experiments in parallel with magnetic tweezers. We use a microscope with a low magnification, and thus a wide field of view, to visualize multiple DNA-tethered paramagnetic beads and apply an optimized image analysis routine to track the three-dimensional position of each bead simultaneously in real time. Force is applied to each bead using an externally applied magnetic field. Since variations in the field parameters are negligible across the field of view, nearly identical manipulation of all visible beads is possible. However, we find that the error in the position measurement is inversely proportional to the microscope's magnification. To mitigate the increased error caused by demagnification, we have developed a strategy based on tracking multiple fixed beads. Our system is capable of simultaneously manipulating and tracking up to 34 DNA-tethered beads at 60 Hz with approximately 1.5 nm resolution and with approximately 10\% variation in applied force.},

abstract = {DNA bridging can be used to induce specific attractions between small particles, providing a highly versatile approach to creating unique particle-based materials having a variety of periodic structures. Surprisingly, given the fact that the thermodynamics of DNA strands in solution are completely understood, existing models for DNA-induced particle interactions are typically in error by more than an order of magnitude in strength and a factor of two in their temperature dependence. This discrepancy has stymied efforts to design the complex temperature, sequence and time-dependent interactions needed for the most interesting applications, such as materials having highly complex or multicomponent microstructures or the ability to reconfigure or self-replicate. Here we report high-spatial resolution measurements of DNA-induced interactions between pairs of polystyrene microspheres at binding strengths comparable to those used in self-assembly experiments, up to 6 k(B)T. We also describe a conceptually straightforward and numerically tractable model that quantitatively captures the separation dependence and temperature-dependent strength of these DNA-induced interactions, without empirical corrections. This model was equally successful when describing the more complex and practically relevant case of grafted DNA brushes with self-interactions that compete with interparticle bridge formation. Together, our findings motivate a nanomaterial design approach where unique functional structures can be found computationally and then reliably realized in experiment.},

abstract = {A substantial school in the philosophy of science identifies Bayesian inference with inductive inference and even rationality as such, and seems to be strengthened by the rise and practical success of Bayesian statistics. We argue that the most successful forms of Bayesian statistics do not actually support that particular philosophy but rather accord much better with sophisticated forms of hypothetico-deductivism. We examine the actual role played by prior distributions in Bayesian models, and the crucial aspects of model checking and model revision, which fall outside the scope of Bayesian confirmation theory. We draw on the literature on the consistency of Bayesian updating and also on our experience of applied work in social science. Clarity about these matters should benefit not just philosophy of science, but also statistical practice. At best, the inductivist view has encouraged researchers to fit and compare models without checking them; at worst, theorists have actively discouraged practitioners from performing model checking because it does not fit into their framework.},

abstract = {We present a method to completely characterize the viscoelasticity of Langmuir monolayers. In contrast to existing techniques, both the compression and shear moduli are determined at the same time, in a single experiment and with a standard apparatus. This approach relies on the measurement of anisotropy in the surface pressure: the tension is measured in orientations perpendicular and parallel to the compression direction. We apply this technique to the study of beta-lactoglobulin spread monolayers, a system that has been shown to develop a shear modulus at high concentration. Beta-lactoglobulin monolayers are interesting both because of their importance in food science and because they exhibit universally slow dynamical behavior that is not fully understood. Our results confirm that the compressional modulus dominates the total viscoelastic response and also provide a complex shear modulus, emerging above a critical concentration. We are able to describe how each of the dynamical response moduli is related to the surface concentration and to the equilibrium osmotic pressure.},

abstract = {Complex fluid-fluid interfaces are common to living systems, foods, personal products, and the environment. They occur wherever surface-active molecules and particles collect at fluid interfaces and render them nonlinear in their response to flow and deformation. When this occurs, the interfaces acquire a complex microstructure that must be interrogated. Interfacial rheological material properties must be measured to appreciate their role in such varied processes as lung function, cell division, and foam and emulsion stability. This review presents the methods that have been devised to determine the microstructure of complex fluid-fluid interfaces. Complex interfacial microstructure leads to rheological complexity. This behavior is often responsible for stabilizing interfacial systems such as foams and emulsions, and it can also have a profound influence on wetting/dewetting dynamics. Interfacial rheological characterization relies on the development of tools with the sensitivity to respond to small surface stresses in a way that isolates them from bulk stresses. This development is relatively recent, and reviews of methods for both shear and dilatational measurements are offered here.},

abstract = {Cells respond to mechanical forces whether applied externally or generated internally via the cytoskeleton. To study the cellular response to forces separately, we applied external forces to cells via microfabricated magnetic posts containing cobalt nanowires interspersed among an array of elastomeric posts, which acted as independent sensors to cellular traction forces. A magnetic field induced torque in the nanowires, which deflected the magnetic posts and imparted force to individual adhesions of cells attached to the array. Using this system, we examined the cellular reaction to applied forces and found that applying a step force led to an increase in local focal adhesion size at the site of application but not at nearby nonmagnetic posts. Focal adhesion recruitment was enhanced further when cells were subjected to multiple force actuations within the same time interval. Recording the traction forces in response to such force stimulation revealed two responses: a sudden loss in contractility that occurred within the first minute of stimulation or a gradual decay in contractility over several minutes. For both types of responses, the subcellular distribution of loss in traction forces was not confined to locations near the actuated micropost, nor uniformly across the whole cell, but instead occurred at discrete locations along the cell periphery. Together, these data reveal an important dynamic biological relationship between external and internal forces and demonstrate the utility of this microfabricated system to explore this interaction.},

abstract = {We investigate the mechanical properties of layers of the protein beta-lactoglobulin during their formation at the air-water interface using a combination of passive and active microrheological techniques. The passive microrheology, which employs multiple particle tracking measurements using spherical colloids, indicates that the interfacial rheology evolves over time through three stages as protein adsorbs at the interface: (i) an increase in viscosity, (ii) a period of spatial heterogeneity in which the interface contains elastic and viscous regions, and (iii) the development of a uniformly rigid elastic film. Varying solution pH between pH = 5.2, the isoelectric point of beta-lactoglobulin, and pH = 7.0 has no qualitative effect on this mechanical evolution. The active microrheology, which employs ferromagnetic nanowires rotating in response to magnetic torques, similarly shows an increasing interfacial viscosity at early times and evidence of mechanical heterogeneity at intermediate times. However, at late times, the nanowire mobility becomes strongly pH dependent. For pH = 5.2, the layer responds as a rigid elastic film to the stress imposed by the wire. For pH = 7.0, it displays a viscous response that contrasts with the passive measurements. We associate this contrast with a nonlinear response to the wire at late times that reflects a low yield stress of the film at higher pH. This ability to compare passive and active measurements demonstrates the advantage of applying multiple microrheological methods to resolve ambiguity in any single approach.},

abstract = {Parotid saliva placed in 35-mm-diameter tissue culture dishes developed increasing surface viscoelasticity at the interface with air. A surface layer became visible with time, and was collected and analysed by protein electrophoresis which indicated that a single protein (pI 4.2; molecular mass approx. 6 kDa) predominated. Western blot analysis demonstrated that the major protein band reacted with an antiserum directed against the C-terminal of the calcium-binding salivary protein statherin. Matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization-time-of-flight MS analysis gave a molecular mass of 5380 Da for the protein, corresponding to the molecular mass of statherin. Staining of film protein in electrophoresis gels was compared with statherin synthesized on a solid phase, and the mean statherin content of film formed from 1 ml of parotid saliva was measured as 7 nmol. The mean calcium content of the surface layer was 250 nmol. Surface rheology was greatly decreased in the presence of EDTA, whereas surface tension of saliva was unaffected by calcium chelation, suggesting that protein accumulated at the surface was unaffected. The results suggest that a layer rich in statherin forms at the interface of saliva and air, and that the surface rheology developed is dependent upon protein interactions mediated by calcium. The surface layer may enhance the function of saliva as a protective layer on the mucosal surfaces and teeth.},

abstract = {The long-time correlation functions of an infinitesimally thin needle moving through stationary point scatterers-a so-called Lorentz model-exhibits surprisingly long-time tails. These long-time tails are now seen to persist in a two-dimensional model even when the needle has a finite thickness. If the needles are too thick, then the needles are effectively trapped at all nontrivial densities of the scatterers. At needle widths approximately equal to or smaller than sigma = epsilon/20 where $\epsilon$ is the average spacing between scatterers, the needle diffuses and exhibits the crossover transition from the expected Enskog behavior to the enhanced translation diffusion seen earlier by H\"{o}fling, Frey and Franosch [ Phys. Rev. Lett. 2008 , 101 , 120605 ]. At this needle width, an increase in its center-of-mass diffusion with respect to increasing density is seen after a crossover density of n* approximately 5 is reached. (The reduced density n* is defined as n* = nL(2) where n is the number density of particles and L is the needle length.) The crossover transition for needles with finite thickness is spread over a range of densities exhibiting intermediate behavior. The asymptotic divergence of the center of mass diffusion is suppressed compared to that of infinitely thin needles. Finally, a new diminished diffusion regime, apparently due to the increased importance of head-on collisions, now appears at high scattering densities.},

abstract = {First, different approaches to detect hydrogen bonds and to evaluate their energies are introduced newly or are extended. Supermolecular interaction energies of 256 dimers, each containing one single hydrogen bond, were correlated to various descriptors by a fit function depending both on the donor and acceptor atoms of the hydrogen bond. On the one hand, descriptors were orbital-based parameters as the two-center or three-center shared electron number, products of ionization potentials and shared electron numbers, and the natural bond orbital interaction energy. On the other hand, integral descriptors examined were the acceptor-proton distance, the hydrogen bond angle, and the IR frequency shift of the donor-proton stretching vibration. Whereas an interaction energy dependence on 1/r(3.8) was established, no correlation was found for the angle. Second, the fit functions are applied to hydrogen bonds in polypeptides, amino acid dimers, and water cluster, thus their reliability is demonstrated. Employing the fit functions to assign intramolecular hydrogen bond energies in polypeptides, several side chain CH...O and CH...N hydrogen bonds were detected on the fly. Also, the fit functions describe rather well intermolecular hydrogen bonds in amino acid dimers and the cooperativity of hydrogen bond energies in water clusters.},

abstract = {The stability of adsorbed protein layers against deformation has in literature been attributed to the formation of a continuous gel-like network. This hypothesis is mostly based on measurements of the increase of the surface shear elasticity with time. For several proteins this increase has been attributed to the formation of intermolecular disulfide bridges between adsorbed proteins. However, according to an alternative model the shear elasticity results from the low mobility of the densely packed proteins. To contribute to this discussion, the actual role of disulfide bridges in interfacial layers is studied. Ovalbumin was thiolated with S-acetylmercaptosuccinic anhydride (S-AMSA), followed by removal of the acetylblock on the sulphur atom, resulting in respectively blocked (SX) and deblocked (SH) ovalbumin variants. This allows comparison of proteins with identical amino acid sequence and similar globular packing and charge distribution, but different chemical reactivity. The presence and reactivity of the introduced, deblocked sulfhydryl groups were confirmed using the sulfhydryl-disulfide exchange index (SEI). Despite the reactivity of the introduced sulfhydryl groups measured in solution, no increase in the surface shear elasticity could be detected with increasing reactivity. This indicates that physical rather than chemical interactions determine the surface shear behaviour. Further experiments were performed in bulk solution to study the conditions needed to induce covalent aggregate formation. From these studies it was found that mere concentration of proteins (to 200 mg/mL, equivalent to a surface concentration of around 2 mg/m(2)) is not sufficient to induce significant aggregation to form a continuous network. In view of these results, it was concluded that the adsorbed layer should not be considered a gelled network of aggregated material (in analogy with three-dimensional gels formed from heating protein solutions). Rather, it would appear that the adsorbed proteins form a highly packed system of proteins with net-repulsive interactions.},

@article{Bos2001,
abstract = {Proteins and low molecular weight (LMW) surfactants are widely used for the physical stabilisation of many emulsions and foam based food products. The formation and stabilisation of these emulsions and foams depend strongly on the interfacial properties of the proteins and the LMW surfactants. Therefore these properties have been studied extensively. In this review an overview is given of interfacial properties of proteins at a mesoscopic scale and the effect of LMW surfactants (emulsifiers) on them. Properties addressed are the adsorbed amount, surface tension (reduction), network formation at interfaces and possible conformational changes during and after adsorption. Special attention is given to interfacial rheological behaviour of proteins at expanding and compressing interfaces, which simulate the behaviour in real emulsions and foams. It will be illustrated that information on interfacial rheological properties, protein conformation and interactions between adsorbed molecules can be obtained by changing experimental conditions. The relation between interfacial rheology and emulsion and foam stabilisation is subsequently addressed. It is concluded that there is a need for new measuring devices that monitor several interfacial properties on a mesoscopic and microscopic scale at the same time, and for physical models describing the various processes of importance for proteins. Real progress will only be possible if both are combined in an innovative way.},

abstract = {Cantilevers and optical tweezers are widely used for micromanipulating cells or biomolecules for measuring their mechanical properties. However, they do not allow easy rotary motion and can sometimes damage the handled material. We present here a system of magnetic tweezers that overcomes those drawbacks while retaining most of the previous dynamometers properties. Electromagnets are coupled to a microscope-based particle tracking system through a digital feedback loop. Magnetic beads are first trapped in a potential well of stiffness approximately 10(-7) N/m. Thus, they can be manipulated in three dimensions at a speed of approximately 10 microm/s and rotated along the optical axis at a frequency of 10 Hz. In addition, our apparatus can work as a dynamometer relying on either usual calibration against the viscous drag or complete calibration using Brownian fluctuations. By stretching a DNA molecule between a magnetic particle and a glass surface, we applied and measured vertical forces ranging from 50 fN to 20 pN. Similarly, nearly horizontal forces up to 5 pN were obtained. From those experiments, we conclude that magnetic tweezers represent a low-cost and biocompatible setup that could become a suitable alternative to the other available micromanipulators.},

abstract = {We report the first experimental demonstration of an active interfacial shear microrheometer (ISMR) that uses a particle trapped by oscillating optical tweezers (OT) to probe the shear modulus G(s)(*)($\omega$) of a gas/liquid interface. The most significant advantages of the oscillating OT in a rheology study are: (1) very high sensitivity compared to other active microrheology methods and (2) the ability to measure both the real and imaginary components of the complex shear modulus without relying on the use of Kramers-Kronig relation, which can be problematic at low frequencies for most of the passive methods. We demonstrate the utilities of our ISMR in two case studies: (1) a 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine monolayer and (2) a composite of poly(styrene sulfonate) and dioctadecyldimethylammonium at the air/water interface in regimes where no other active instruments can explore.},

@article{Rudnick1987a,
abstract = {A theoretical description of the shape of a random object is presented that is analytically simple in application but quantitatively accurate. The asymmetry of the object is characterized in terms of the invariants of a tensor, analogous to the moment-of-inertia tensor, whose eigenvalues are the squares of the principal radii of gyration. The complications accompanying ensemble averaging because of random processes are greatly reduced when the object is embedded in a space of high dimensionality, d. Exact analytical expressions are presented in the case of infinite spatial dimensions, and a procedure for developing an expansion in powers of l/d is discussed for linear chain and ring-type random walks. The first two terms in such an expansion lead to results for various shape parameters that agree remarkably well with those calculated by computer simulation. The method can be extended to yield an approximate, but extremely accurate, expression for the probability distribution function directly. The theoretical approach discussed here can, in principle, be used to describe the shape of other random fractal objects as well.},
