abstract = {We study the autonomous motion of catalytic nanorods in Gibbs monolayers. The catalytic activity of the rods on a hydrogen peroxide aqueous subphase gives rise to anomalous translational and rotational diffusion. The rods perform a Levy-walk superdiffusive motion that can be decomposed into thermal orientation fluctuations and an active motion of the rods with a constant velocity along their long axis. Since interfacial dissipation increases relative to bulk phase dissipation when miniaturizing the size of objects moving in the interface, the autonomous nanorods allow for precise measurements of surface shear viscosities as low as a few nN s/m. The cross over from active motion toward passive diffusion when increasing the surfactant concentration is explained by a loss of friction asymmetry of the rods.},

Because manually detecting and following large numbers of individual particles is not feasible, automated computational methods have been developed for these tasks by many groups.

Performance was assessed using commonly defined measures. Although no single method performed best across all scenarios, the results revealed clear differences between the various approaches, leading to notable practical conclusions for users and developers.},

Introduction. With the human genome, the guiding vision of molecular biology has reached its end, but this is not the "Holy Grail" of biology itself. We need a new guiding vision.
        
Reductionism vs. Reductionism. Empirical reductionism is useful, but fundamental reductionism inherited from 19th century physics ("a thing is no more than the sum of its parts") is pernicious.
        
Synthesis. "Molecular biology could read the notes in the score, but it couldn't hear the music."
        
Towards a New Respresentation of Biology. Evolution is what distinguished the living world from inanimate. Understanding evolution and biological form must not be dismissed as fundamentally inexplicable or as historical accidents; they must be fundamentally relevant to our representation

@article{Gosse2002,
abstract = {Cantilevers and optical tweezers are widely used for micromanipulating cells or biomolecules for measuring their mechanical properties. However, they do not allow easy rotary motion and can sometimes damage the handled material. We present here a system of magnetic tweezers that overcomes those drawbacks while retaining most of the previous dynamometers properties. Electromagnets are coupled to a microscope-based particle tracking system through a digital feedback loop. Magnetic beads are first trapped in a potential well of stiffness approximately 10(-7) N/m. Thus, they can be manipulated in three dimensions at a speed of approximately 10 microm/s and rotated along the optical axis at a frequency of 10 Hz. In addition, our apparatus can work as a dynamometer relying on either usual calibration against the viscous drag or complete calibration using Brownian fluctuations. By stretching a DNA molecule between a magnetic particle and a glass surface, we applied and measured vertical forces ranging from 50 fN to 20 pN. Similarly, nearly horizontal forces up to 5 pN were obtained. From those experiments, we conclude that magnetic tweezers represent a low-cost and biocompatible setup that could become a suitable alternative to the other available micromanipulators.},

@article{Abbasnezhad2011,
abstract = {Biodegradation of poorly water-soluble liquid hydrocarbons is often limited by low availability of the substrate to microbes. Adhesion of microorganisms to an oil-water interface can enhance this availability, whereas detaching cells from the interface can reduce the rate of biodegradation. The capability of microbes to adhere to the interface is not limited to hydrocarbon degraders, nor is it the only mechanism to enable rapid uptake of hydrocarbons, but it represents a common strategy. This review of the literature indicates that microbial adhesion can benefit growth on and biodegradation of very poorly water-soluble hydrocarbons such as n-alkanes and large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons dissolved in a non-aqueous phase. Adhesion is particularly important when the hydrocarbons are not emulsified, giving limited interfacial area between the two liquid phases. When mixed communities are involved in biodegradation, the ability of cells to adhere to the interface can enable selective growth and enhance bioremediation with time. The critical challenge in understanding the relationship between growth rate and biodegradation rate for adherent bacteria is to accurately measure and observe the population that resides at the interface of the hydrocarbon phase.},

abstract = {Video-based particle tracking monitors the microscopic movement of labeled biomolecules and fluorescent probes within a complex cellular environment. Information gained from this technique enables us to extract the dynamic behavior of biomolecules and the local mechanical properties inside the cell from a tracked particle's mean-square displacement (MSD). However, MSD measurements are highly susceptible to static error introduced by noise in the image acquisition process that leads to an incorrect positioning of the particle. Static error can mask the subtle effects from the local microenvironment on the MSD and potentially generate misleading conclusions about the biophysical properties of cells. An approach that greatly increases the accuracy of MSD measurements is presented herein by combining experimental data with Monte Carlo simulations to eliminate the inherent static error. This practical method of static error correction greatly advances particle-tracking techniques.},

Here, we report that the influence of Brownian motion is amplified when it is coupled to hydrodynamic interaction. We examine swimming trajectories of the singly flagellated bacterium Caulobacter crescentus near a glass surface with total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and observe large fluctuations over time in the distance of the cell from the solid surface caused by Brownian motion. The observation is compared with computer simulation based on analysis of relevant physical factors, including electrostatics, van der Waals force, hydrodynamics, and Brownian motion. The simulation reproduces the experimental findings and reveals contribution from fluctuations of the cell orientation beyond the resolution of present observation. Coupled with hydrodynamic interaction between the bacterium and the boundary surface, the fluctuations in distance and orientation subsequently lead to variation of the swimming speed and local radius of curvature of swimming trajectory. These results shed light on the fundamental roles of Brownian motion in microbial motility, nutrient uptake, and adhesion.},

abstract = {Bacterial adhesion has become a significant problem in industry and in the domicile, and much research has been done for deeper understanding of the processes involved. A generic biological model of bacterial adhesion and population growth called the bacterial biofilm growth cycle, has been described and modified many times. The biofilm growth cycle encompasses bacterial adhesion at all levels, starting with the initial physical attraction of bacteria to a substrate, and ending with the eventual liberation of cell clusters from the biofilm matrix. When describing bacterial adhesion one is simply describing one or more stages of biofilm development, neglecting the fact that the population may not reach maturity. This article provides an overview of bacterial adhesion, cites examples of how bacterial adhesion affects industry and summarises methods and instrumentation used to improve our understanding of the adhesive properties of bacteria.},

abstract = {This paper presents a computationally efficient, two-dimensional, feature point tracking algorithm for the automated detection and quantitative analysis of particle trajectories as recorded by video imaging in cell biology. The tracking process requires no a priori mathematical modeling of the motion, it is self-initializing, it discriminates spurious detections, and it can handle temporary occlusion as well as particle appearance and disappearance from the image region. The efficiency of the algorithm is validated on synthetic video data where it is compared to existing methods and its accuracy and precision are assessed for a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios. The algorithm is well suited for video imaging in cell biology relying on low-intensity fluorescence microscopy. Its applicability is demonstrated in three case studies involving transport of low-density lipoproteins in endosomes, motion of fluorescently labeled Adenovirus-2 particles along microtubules, and tracking of quantum dots on the plasma membrane of live cells. The present automated tracking process enables the quantification of dispersive processes in cell biology using techniques such as moment scaling spectra.},

abstract = {Hydrodynamic conditions control two interlinked parameters; mass transfer and drag, and will, therefore, significantly influence many of the processes involved in biofilm development. The goal of this research was to determine the effect of flow velocity and nutrients on biofilm structure. Biofilms were grown in square glass capillary flow cells under laminar and turbulent flows. Biofilms were observed microscopically under flow conditions using image analysis. Mixed species bacterial biofilms were grown with glucose (40 mg/l) as the limiting nutrient. Biofilms grown under laminar conditions were patchy and consisted of roughly circular cell clusters separated by interstitial voids. Biofilms in the turbulent flow cell were also patchy but these biofilms consisted of patches of ripples and elongated 'streamers' which oscillated in the flow. To assess the influence of changing nutrient conditions on biofilm structure the glucose concentration was increased from 40 to 400 mg/l on an established 21 day old biofilm growing in turbulent flow. The cell clusters grew rapidly and the thickness of the biofilm increased from 30 $\mu$ to 130 $\mu$ within 17 h. The ripples disappeared after 10 hours. After 5 d the glucose concentration was reduced back to 40 mg/l. There was a loss of biomass and patches of ripples were re-established within a further 2 d.},

abstract = {The ability of mucus to function as a protective barrier at mucosal surfaces rests on its viscous and elastic properties, which are not well understood at length scales relevant to pathogens and ultrafine environmental particles. Here we report that fresh, undiluted human cervicovaginal mucus (CVM) transitions from an impermeable elastic barrier to non-adhesive objects sized 1 microm and larger to a highly permeable viscoelastic liquid to non-adhesive objects smaller than 500 nm in diameter. Addition of a nonionic detergent, present in vaginal gels, lubricants and condoms, caused CVM to behave as an impermeable elastic barrier to 200 and 500 nm particles, suggesting that the dissociation of hydrophobically-bundled mucin fibers created a finer elastic mucin mesh. Surprisingly, the macroscopic viscoelasticity, which is critical to proper mucus function, was unchanged. These findings provide important insight into the nanoscale structural and barrier properties of mucus, and how the penetration of foreign particles across mucus might be inhibited.},

But in disordered systems anomalous diffusion may occur, in which the mean-square displacement is proportional to some other power of time. In the presence of moderate concentrations of obstacles, diffusion is anomalous over short distances and normal over long distances. Monte Carlo calculations are used to characterize anomalous diffusion for obstacle concentrations between zero and the percolation threshold. As the obstacle concentration approaches the percolation threshold, diffusion becomes more anomalous over longer distances; the anomalous diffusion exponent and the crossover length both increase. The crossover length and time show whether anomalous diffusion can be observed in a given experiment.},

abstract = {The mechanical properties of biofilms and in particular their mechanical strength is of great importance for both biofilm reactors and for the removal of undesired biofilms as in cases of biofouling and biocorrosion. By uniaxial compression measurements, it is possible to determine the apparent elastic or Young's modulus and the yield stress as parameters for mechanical stability. This was performed with a recently developed device, using model biofilms of mucoid strain Pseudomonas aeruginosa SG81. The biofilms were grown on membrane filters placed on nutrient agar medium with different concentrations of calcium ions. The compressive stress-strain behaviour up to failure was recorded at a compression speed of 1 micron s-1. The apparent Young's modulus, representing the stiffness of the biofilm, and the yield stress obtained from the stress--strain diagram were used for the description of mechanical properties of biofilms. A certain critical concentration of calcium ions was found where the Young's modulus of the P. aeruginosa biofilms increases strongly and subsequently remains constant for higher calcium concentrations. This behaviour is explained by the presence of calcium ions crosslinking alginate, which is the major component of the extracellular polymeric substances produced by the mucoid P. aeruginosa strain used in this investigation.},

abstract = {As our knowledge of biological processes advances, we are increasingly aware that cells actively position sub-cellular organelles and other constituents to control a wide range of biological processes. Many studies quantify the position and motion of, for example, fluorescently labeled proteins, protein aggregates, mRNA particles or virus particles. Both differential interference contrast (DIC) and fluorescence microscopy can visualize vesicles, nuclei or other small organelles moving inside cells. While such studies are increasingly important, there has been no complete analysis of the different tracking methods in use, especially from the practical point of view. Here we investigate these methods and clarify how well different algorithms work and also which factors play a role in assessing how accurately the position of an object can be determined. Specifically, we consider how ultimate performance is affected by magnification, by camera type (analog versus digital), by recording medium (VHS and SVHS tape versus direct tracking from camera), by image compression, by type of imaging used (fluorescence versus DIC images) and by a variety of sources of noise. We show that most methods are capable of nanometer scale accuracy under realistic conditions; tracking accuracy decreases with increasing noise. Surprisingly, accuracy is found to be insensitive to the numerical aperture, but, as expected, it scales with magnification, with higher magnification yielding improved accuracy (within limits of signal-to-noise). When noise is present at reasonable levels, the effect of image compression is in most cases small. Finally, we provide a free, robust implementation of a tracking algorithm that is easily downloaded and installed.},

abstract = {Fluid mixing in active suspensions of microorganisms is important to ecological phenomena and presents a fascinating stochastic process. We investigate the mixing produced by swimming unicellular algal cells (Chlamydomonas) in quasi-two-dimensional liquid films by simultaneously tracking the motion of the cells and that of microscopic passive tracer particles advected by the fluid. The reduced spatial dimension of the system leads to long-range flows and a surprisingly strong dependence of tracer transport on the concentration of swimmers, which is explored over a wide range. The mean square displacements are well described by a stochastic Langevin model, which is used to parameterize the mixing. The effective diffusion coefficient D grows rapidly with the swimmer concentration $\Phi$ as D ∼ $\Phi$(3/2), as a result of the increasing frequency of tracer-swimmer interactions and the long-range hydrodynamic disturbances created by the swimmers. Conditional sampling of the tracer data based on the instantaneous swimmer position shows that the rapid growth of the diffusivity enhancement with concentration must be due to particle interactions with multiple swimmers simultaneously. Finally, the anomalous probability distributions of tracer displacements become Gaussian at high concentration, but manifest strong power-law tails at low concentration, while the tracer displacements always grow diffusively in time.},

abstract = {The rheology of self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDS) is not thoroughly characterized these days. Since mechanical rheometers are often not well suited to study this kind of systems, there is need for novel physical methods. Several new optical techniques based on microrheology have recently made significant progress. We apply for the first time a specific microrheological technique called diffusing wave spectroscopy (DWS) to study different SEDDS. The obtained data were then correlated with the dosing precision of automated capsule filling. As a result, the dynamic viscosities obtained from microrheology were in accordance with data from capillary viscosimetry. The DWS measurements revealed that all formulations had a clearly measurable storage modulus at frequencies >200 rad/s. Thus, all samples were low-viscous, while exhibiting non-Newtonian flow behavior. Obtained values of storage and loss modulus were then successfully correlated with the weight variability of capsules that were filled on a machine. In conclusion, the DWS technique enabled rheological analysis of self-emulsifying systems in a broad frequency range. The good data correlation with a capsule quality attribute was especially promising, since microrheological techniques are typically contact-free. Thus, they have a high potential in a quality by design framework of formulation development and production.},

abstract = {A review in which many original published results of the authors as well as many other papers are discussed. The structure and some properties of the globular proteins are shortly presented, special accent being put on the alpha-chymotrypsin (alpha-ChT), lysozyme (LZ), human serum albumin (HSA), and bovine serum albumin (BSA) which have been used in the experiments with thin liquid films. The behaviour of protein adsorption layers (PAL) is extensively discussed. The dynamics of PAL formation, including the kinetics of adsorption as well as the time evolution of the surface tension of protein aqueous solutions, are considered. A considerable place is devoted to the surface tension and adsorption isotherms of the globular protein solutions, the simulation of PAL by interacting hard spheres, the experimental surface tension isotherms of the above mentioned proteins, and the interfacial tension isotherms for the protein aqueous solution/oil interface. The rheological properties of PAL at fluid interfaces are shortly reviewed. After a brief information about the experimental methods for investigation of protein thin liquid (foam or emulsion) films, the properties of the protein black foam films are extensively discussed: the conditions for their formation, the influence of the electrolytes and pH on the film type and stability, the thermodynamic properties of the black foam films, the contact angles film/bulk and their dynamic hysteresis. The next center of attention concerns some properties of the protein emulsion films: the conditions for formation of emulsion black films, the formation and development of a dimpling in microscopic, circular films. The protein-phospholipid mixed foam films are also briefly considered.},

abstract = {DNA bridging can be used to induce specific attractions between small particles, providing a highly versatile approach to creating unique particle-based materials having a variety of periodic structures. Surprisingly, given the fact that the thermodynamics of DNA strands in solution are completely understood, existing models for DNA-induced particle interactions are typically in error by more than an order of magnitude in strength and a factor of two in their temperature dependence. This discrepancy has stymied efforts to design the complex temperature, sequence and time-dependent interactions needed for the most interesting applications, such as materials having highly complex or multicomponent microstructures or the ability to reconfigure or self-replicate. Here we report high-spatial resolution measurements of DNA-induced interactions between pairs of polystyrene microspheres at binding strengths comparable to those used in self-assembly experiments, up to 6 k(B)T. We also describe a conceptually straightforward and numerically tractable model that quantitatively captures the separation dependence and temperature-dependent strength of these DNA-induced interactions, without empirical corrections. This model was equally successful when describing the more complex and practically relevant case of grafted DNA brushes with self-interactions that compete with interparticle bridge formation. Together, our findings motivate a nanomaterial design approach where unique functional structures can be found computationally and then reliably realized in experiment.},

abstract = {Microbial adhesion is an important factor that can influence biodegradation of poorly water soluble hydrocarbons such as phenanthrene. This study examined how adhesion to an oil-water interface, as mediated by 1-dodecanol, enhanced phenanthrene biodegradation by Pseudomonas fluorescens LP6a. Phenanthrene was dissolved in heptamethylnonane and added to the aerobic aqueous growth medium to form a two phase mixture. 1-Dodecanol was non-toxic and furthermore could be biodegraded slowly by this strain. The alcohol promoted adhesion of the bacterial cells to the oil-water interface without significantly changing the interfacial or surface tension. Introducing 1-dodecanol at concentrations from 217 to 4,100 mg l(-1) increased phenanthrene biodegradation by about 30\% after 120 h incubation. After 100 h incubation, cultures initially containing 120 or 160 mg l(-1) 1-dodecanol had mineralized >10\% of the phenanthrene whereas those incubated without 1-dodecanol had mineralized only 4.5\%. The production and accumulation of putative phenanthrene metabolites in the aqueous phase of cultures likewise increased in response to the addition of 1-dodecanol. The results suggest that enhanced adhesion of bacterial cells to the oil-water interface was the main factor responsible for enhanced biodegradation of phenanthrene to presumed polar metabolites and to CO(2).},

abstract = {The physical nature of the bacterial cytoplasm is poorly understood even though it determines cytoplasmic dynamics and hence cellular physiology and behavior. Through single-particle tracking of protein filaments, plasmids, storage granules, and foreign particles of different sizes, we find that the bacterial cytoplasm displays properties that are characteristic of glass-forming liquids and changes from liquid-like to solid-like in a component size-dependent fashion. As a result, the motion of cytoplasmic components becomes disproportionally constrained with increasing size. Remarkably, cellular metabolism fluidizes the cytoplasm, allowing larger components to escape their local environment and explore larger regions of the cytoplasm. Consequently, cytoplasmic fluidity and dynamics dramatically change as cells shift between metabolically active and dormant states in response to fluctuating environments. Our findings provide insight into bacterial dormancy and have broad implications to our understanding of bacterial physiology, as the glassy behavior of the cytoplasm impacts all intracellular processes involving large components.},

@article{Banat2010,
abstract = {Microorganisms synthesise a wide range of surface-active compounds (SAC), generally called biosurfactants. These compounds are mainly classified according to their molecular weight, physico-chemical properties and mode of action. The low-molecular-weight SACs or biosurfactants reduce the surface tension at the air/water interfaces and the interfacial tension at oil/water interfaces, whereas the high-molecular-weight SACs, also called bioemulsifiers, are more effective in stabilising oil-in-water emulsions. Biosurfactants are attracting much interest due to their potential advantages over their synthetic counterparts in many fields spanning environmental, food, biomedical, and other industrial applications. Their large-scale application and production, however, are currently limited by the high cost of production and by limited understanding of their interactions with cells and with the abiotic environment. In this paper, we review the current knowledge and the latest advances in biosurfactant applications and the biotechnological strategies being developed for improving production processes and future potential.},

abstract = {Microbial adhesion to the oil-water interface is an important parameter in biodegradation of hydrocarbons to enhance uptake and metabolism of compounds with very low aqueous solubility, but the mechanisms of adhesion are not well understood. Our approach was to study a range of compounds and mechanisms to promote the adhesion of a hydrophilic bacterium, Pseudomonas fluorescens strain LP6a, to an oil-water interface. The cationic surfactants cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), poly-l-lysine and chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX) and the long chain alcohols 1-dodecanol and farnesol increased the adhesion of P. fluorescens LP6a to n-hexadecane from ca. 30 to 90\% of suspended cells adhering. In contrast, adjusting the ionic strength of the suspending medium only increased the adhesion from about 8 to 30\%. The alcohols, 1-dodecanol and farnesol, also caused a dramatic change in the oil-water contact angle of the cell surface, increasing it from 24 degrees to 104 degrees , whereas the cationic compounds had little effect. In contrast, cationic compounds changed the electrophoretic mobility of the bacteria, reducing the mean zeta potential from -23 to -7 mV in 0.01 M potassium phosphate buffer, but the alcohols, 1-dodecanol and farnesol, had no effect on zeta potential. Even though both types of compounds promoted cell adhesion to the n-hexadecane interface, the mechanisms were different. Alcohols acted through altering the cell surface hydrophobicity, whereas cationic surfactants changed the surface charge density.},

We use a microscope with a low magnification, and thus a wide field of view, to visualize multiple DNA-tethered paramagnetic beads and apply an optimized image analysis routine to track the three-dimensional position of each bead simultaneously in real time. Force is applied to each bead using an externally applied magnetic field. Since variations in the field parameters are negligible across the field of view, nearly identical manipulation of all visible beads is possible. However, we find that the error in the position measurement is inversely proportional to the microscope's magnification. To mitigate the increased error caused by demagnification, we have developed a strategy based on tracking multiple fixed beads. Our system is capable of simultaneously manipulating and tracking up to 34 DNA-tethered beads at 60 Hz with approximately 1.5 nm resolution and with approximately 10\% variation in applied force.},

abstract = {Superresolution localization microscopy methods produce nanoscale images via a combination of intermittently active fluorescent probes and algorithms that can precisely determine the positions of these probes from single-molecule or few-molecule images. These algorithms vary widely in their underlying principles, complexity, and accuracy. In this review, we begin by surveying the principles of localization microscopy and describing the fundamental limits to localization precision. We then examine several different families of fluorophore localization algorithms, comparing their complexity, performance, and range of applicability (e.g., whether they require particular types of experimental information, are optimized for specific situations, or are more general). Whereas our focus is on the localization of single isotropic emitters in two dimensions, we also consider oriented dipoles, three-dimensional localization, and algorithms that can handle overlapping images of several nearby fluorophores. Throughout the review, we try to highlight practical advice for users of fluorophore localization algorithms, as well as open questions.},

abstract = {We present experiments in which single proteins were imaged and tracked within mammalian cells. Single proteins of R-phycoerythrin (RPE) were imaged by epifluorescence microscopy in the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm at 71 frames/s. We acquired two-dimensional trajectories of proteins (corresponding to the projection of three-dimensional trajectories onto the plane of focus) for an average of 17 frames in the cytoplasm and 16 frames in the nucleus. Diffusion constants were determined from linear fits to the mean square displacement and from the mean displacement squared per frame. We find that the distribution of diffusion constants for RPE within cells is broader than the distributions obtained from RPE in a glycerol solution, from a Monte Carlo simulation, and from the theoretical distribution for simple diffusion. This suggests that on the time scales of our measurements, the motion of single RPE proteins in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm cannot be modeled by simple diffusion with a unique diffusion constant. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to follow the motion of single proteins within cells and that the technique of single molecule tracking can be used to probe the dynamics of intracellular macromolecules.},

abstract = {Mucus typically traps and rapidly removes foreign particles from the airways, gastrointestinal tract, nasopharynx, female reproductive tract and the surface of the eye. Nanoparticles capable of rapid penetration through mucus can potentially avoid rapid clearance, and open significant opportunities for controlled drug delivery at mucosal surfaces. Here, we report an industrially scalable emulsification method to produce biodegradable mucus-penetrating particles (MPP). The emulsification of diblock copolymers of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) and polyethylene glycol (PLGA-PEG) using low molecular weight (MW) emulsifiers forms dense brush PEG coatings on nanoparticles that allow rapid nanoparticle penetration through fresh undiluted human mucus. In comparison, conventional high MW emulsifiers, such as polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), interrupts the PEG coating on nanoparticles, resulting in their immobilization in mucus owing to adhesive interactions with mucus mesh elements. PLGA-PEG nanoparticles with a wide range of PEG MW (1, 2, 5, and 10 kDa), prepared by the emulsification method using low MW emulsifiers, all rapidly penetrated mucus. A range of drugs, from hydrophobic small molecules to hydrophilic large biologics, can be efficiently loaded into biodegradable MPP using the method described. This readily scalable method should facilitate the production of MPP products for mucosal drug delivery, as well as potentially longer-circulating particles following intravenous administration.},

abstract = {This study focuses on how intact, hydrophobic bacteria in their stationary (i.e., non-dividing) phase could adsorb onto the hexadecane-water interface and alter its mechanical properties. The two strains of bacteria used in forming the interfacial films were Acinetobacter venetianus RAG-1 and Rhodococcus erythropolis 20S-E1-c. Using the dynamic pendant drop technique, the film interfacial tension was monitored as the surface area was made to undergo transient changes. Under static conditions, both types of bacteria had no effect on the interfacial tension. When subjected to transient excitations, however, the two bacterial films exhibited clear and qualitatively similar rheological properties: they responded as two-dimensional Maxwellian materials when the interfacial areas were dilated suddenly, but appeared to be purely elastic upon rapid area compression. Such rheological behaviours are "non-linear" in that the responses of the tension to area dilation and contraction are not mirror images of one another. Despite their qualitative similarities, the two types of film had very distinct film elasticities and relaxation times. The most striking difference between the two bacterial films was revealed under continuous reduction of area, when the A. venetianus RAG-1 system displayed a "paper-like" interface, whereas the interface of the R. erythropolis 20S-E1-c system was "soap film-like". These macroscopic observations could be explained by the surface ultrastructures of the two cell strains determined using transmission electron microscopy.},

abstract = {Microorganisms such as bacteria and many eukaryotic cells propel themselves with hair-like structures known as flagella, which can exhibit a variety of structures and movement patterns. For example, bacterial flagella are helically shaped and driven at their bases by a reversible rotary engine, which rotates the attached flagellum to give a motion similar to that of a corkscrew. In contrast, eukaryotic cells use flagella that resemble elastic rods and exhibit a beating motion: internally generated stresses give rise to a series of bends that propagate towards the tip. In contrast to this variety of swimming strategies encountered in nature, a controlled swimming motion of artificial micrometre-sized structures has not yet been realized. Here we show that a linear chain of colloidal magnetic particles linked by DNA and attached to a red blood cell can act as a flexible artificial flagellum. The filament aligns with an external uniform magnetic field and is readily actuated by oscillating a transverse field. We find that the actuation induces a beating pattern that propels the structure, and that the external fields can be adjusted to control the velocity and the direction of motion.},

Here we present a generic fluidic approach using convection and alternating flow to rapidly generate multi-centimeter gradients of biomolecules, polymers, beads and cells and cross-gradients of two species in a microchannel. Accompanying theoretical estimates and simulations of gradient growth provide design criteria over a range of material properties. A poly(ethylene-glycol) hydrogel gradient, a porous collagen gradient and a composite material with a hyaluronic acid/gelatin cross-gradient were generated with continuous variations in material properties and in their ability to regulate cellular response. This simple yet generic fluidic platform should prove useful for creating anisotropic biomimetic materials and high-throughput platforms for investigating cell-microenvironment interactions.},

abstract = {Recent studies have shown that high levels of speech understanding could be achieved when the speech spectrum was divided into four channels and then reconstructed as a sum of four noise bands or sine waves with frequencies equal to the center frequencies of the channels. In these studies speech understanding was assessed using sentences produced by a single male talker. The aim of experiment 1 was to assess the number of channels necessary for a high level of speech understanding when sentences were produced by multiple talkers. In experiment 1, sentences produced by 135 different talkers were processed through n (2n16) number of channels, synthesized as a sum of n sine waves with frequencies equal to the center frequencies of the filters, and presented to normal-hearing listeners for identification. A minimum of five channels was needed to achieve a high level 90\% of speech understanding. Asymptotic performance was achieved with eight channels, at least for the speech material used in this study. The outcome of experiment 1 demonstrated that the number of channels needed to reach asymptotic performance varies as a function of the recognition task and/or need for listeners to attend to fine phonetic detail. In experiment 2, sentences were processed through 6 and 16 channels and quantized into a small number of steps. The purpose of this experiment was to investigate whether listeners use across-channel differences in amplitude to code frequency information, particularly when speech is processed through a small number of channels. For sentences processed through six channels there was a significant reduction in speech understanding when the spectral amplitudes were quantized into a small number 8 of steps. High levels 92\% of speech understanding were maintained for sentences processed through 16 channels and quantized into only 2 steps. The findings of experiment 2 suggest an inverse relationship between the importance of spectral amplitude resolution number of steps and spectral resolution number of channels.},

abstract = {Quantitative tracking of particle motion using live-cell imaging is a powerful approach to understanding the mechanism of transport of biological molecules, organelles, and cells. However, inferring complex stochastic motion models from single-particle trajectories in an objective manner is nontrivial due to noise from sampling limitations and biological heterogeneity. Here, we present a systematic Bayesian approach to multiple-hypothesis testing of a general set of competing motion models based on particle mean-square displacements that automatically classifies particle motion, properly accounting for sampling limitations and correlated noise while appropriately penalizing model complexity according to Occam's Razor to avoid over-fitting. We test the procedure rigorously using simulated trajectories for which the underlying physical process is known, demonstrating that it chooses the simplest physical model that explains the observed data. Further, we show that computed model probabilities provide a reliability test for the downstream biological interpretation of associated parameter values. We subsequently illustrate the broad utility of the approach by applying it to disparate biological systems including experimental particle trajectories from chromosomes, kinetochores, and membrane receptors undergoing a variety of complex motions. This automated and objective Bayesian framework easily scales to large numbers of particle trajectories, making it ideal for classifying the complex motion of large numbers of single molecules and cells from high-throughput screens, as well as single-cell-, tissue-, and organism-level studies.},

We present here the theoretical basis for the analysis of these trajectories for particles undergoing random diffusion and/or systematic transport at uniform velocity in two-dimensional systems. The single particle tracking method, based on observations of the trajectories of individual particles, is compared with methods that characterize the motions of a large collection of particles such as fluorescence photobleaching recovery. Determination of diffusion coefficients or transport velocities either from correlation of positions or of velocities of the particles is discussed. A result of practical importance is an analysis of the dependence of the expected statistical uncertainty of these determinations on the number of position measurements. This provides a way of judging the accuracy of the diffusion coefficients and transport velocities obtained using this approach.},

abstract = {We present the first characterization of the mechanical properties of lysozyme films formed by self-assembly at the air-water interface using the Cambridge interfacial tensiometer (CIT), an apparatus capable of subjecting protein films to a much higher level of extensional strain than traditional dilatational techniques. CIT analysis, which is insensitive to surface pressure, provides a direct measure of the extensional stress-strain behavior of an interfacial film without the need to assume a mechanical model (e.g., viscoelastic), and without requiring difficult-to-test assumptions regarding low-strain material linearity. This testing method has revealed that the bulk solution pH from which assembly of an interfacial lysozyme film occurs influences the mechanical properties of the film more significantly than is suggested by the observed differences in elastic moduli or surface pressure. We have also identified a previously undescribed pH dependency in the effect of solution ionic strength on the mechanical strength of the lysozyme films formed at the air-water interface. Increasing solution ionic strength was found to increase lysozyme film strength when assembly occurred at pH 7, but it caused a decrease in film strength at pH 11, close to the pI of lysozyme. This result is discussed in terms of the significant contribution made to protein film strength by both electrostatic interactions and the hydrophobic effect. Washout experiments to remove protein from the bulk phase have shown that a small percentage of the interfacially adsorbed lysozyme molecules are reversibly adsorbed. Finally, the washout tests have probed the role played by additional adsorption to the fresh interface formed by the application of a large strain to the lysozyme film and have suggested the movement of reversibly bound lysozyme molecules from a subinterfacial layer to the interface.},

abstract = {It has been widely acknowledged that self-replicating space-probes (SRPs) could explore the galaxy very quickly relative to the age of the galaxy. An obvious implication is that SRPs produced by extraterrestrial civilizations should have arrived in our solar system millions of years ago, and furthermore, that new probes from an ever-arising supply of civilizations ought to be arriving on a constant basis. The lack of observations of such probes underlies a frequently cited variation of the Fermi Paradox. We believe that a predilection for ETI-optimistic theories has deterred consideration of incompatible theories. Notably, SRPs have virtually disappeared from the literature. In this paper, we consider the most common arguments against SRPs and find those arguments lacking. By extension, we find recent models of galactic exploration which explicitly exclude SRPs to be unfairly handicapped and unlikely to represent natural scenarios.   We also consider several other models that seek to explain the Fermi Paradox, most notably percolation theory and two societal-collapse theories. In the former case, we find that it imposes unnatural assumptions which likely render it unrealistic. In the latter case, we present a new theory of interstellar transportation bandwidth which calls into question the validity of societal-collapse theories.   Finally, we offer our thoughts on how to design future SETI programs which take the conclusions of this paper into account to maximize the chance of detection.},

abstract = {We investigate the mechanical properties of layers of the protein beta-lactoglobulin during their formation at the air-water interface using a combination of passive and active microrheological techniques. The passive microrheology, which employs multiple particle tracking measurements using spherical colloids, indicates that the interfacial rheology evolves over time through three stages as protein adsorbs at the interface: (i) an increase in viscosity, (ii) a period of spatial heterogeneity in which the interface contains elastic and viscous regions, and (iii) the development of a uniformly rigid elastic film. Varying solution pH between pH = 5.2, the isoelectric point of beta-lactoglobulin, and pH = 7.0 has no qualitative effect on this mechanical evolution. The active microrheology, which employs ferromagnetic nanowires rotating in response to magnetic torques, similarly shows an increasing interfacial viscosity at early times and evidence of mechanical heterogeneity at intermediate times. However, at late times, the nanowire mobility becomes strongly pH dependent. For pH = 5.2, the layer responds as a rigid elastic film to the stress imposed by the wire. For pH = 7.0, it displays a viscous response that contrasts with the passive measurements. We associate this contrast with a nonlinear response to the wire at late times that reflects a low yield stress of the film at higher pH. This ability to compare passive and active measurements demonstrates the advantage of applying multiple microrheological methods to resolve ambiguity in any single approach.},

abstract = {Interfacial transport phenomena play an important role in the dynamics of liquid interfaces found in emulsions, foams, and membranes. Both macroscopic and microscopic measurements of interfacial transport and rheology can be made, the former typically relying on the use of at least millimeter-scale probes, and the latter exploiting the motion of micrometer-scale probes. Recent publications have shown multiple orders of magnitude differences between experimentally observed diffusivities in passive microrheology, and the diffusivities expected based on macroscopic measurements of the surface rheology. In the present work, interfacial rheological measurements were made with both microrheological and macrorheological methods and the results are compared for different monolayers at an air-water interface. We have identified multiple aspects of particle-tracking microrheology that can contribute to orders-of-magnitude disagreement with macrorheological methods. In particular, unintentional tracking of particles not residing at the interface, the presence of large-scale interfacial heterogeneities, and underestimating static noise can all decrease estimates of surface viscosity from particle-tracking microrheology by orders of magnitude. After taking care to address these artifacts, we show that viscosities obtained from both methods agree well for poly(tert-butyl methacrylate) (PtBMA), and for dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), but disagree by orders of magnitude for hexadecanol. In poly(tert-butyl acrylate) (PtBA), large-scale heterogeneities prevented us from obtaining representative surface viscosities. By making surface viscosity measurements in an interfacial stress rheometer (ISR) with needles of different aspect ratio, we show that compressibility or Marangoni stress related effects may be contributing to the orders of magnitude disagreement in micro and macrorheological measurements observed in the hexadecanol system.},

Water filling is strongly cooperative, with the possible coexistence of filled and empty states and sensitivity to small perturbations of the pore polarity and solvent conditions. Confined water molecules form tightly hydrogen-bonded wires or clusters. The weak attractions to the confining wall, combined with strong interactions between water molecules, permit exceptionally rapid water flow, exceeding expectations from macroscopic hydrodynamics by several orders of magnitude. The proton mobility along 1D water wires also substantially exceeds that in the bulk. Proteins appear to exploit these unusual properties of confined water in their biological function (e.g., to ensure rapid water flow in aquaporins or to gate proton flow in proton pumps and enzymes). The unusual properties of water in nonpolar confinement are also relevant to the design of novel nanofluidic and molecular separation devices or fuel cells.},

abstract = {Hexagons can easily tile a flat surface, but not a curved one. Introducing heptagons and pentagons (defects with topological charge) makes it easier to tile curved surfaces; for example, soccer balls based on the geodesic domes of Buckminster Fuller have exactly 12 pentagons (positive charges). Interacting particles that invariably form hexagonal crystals on a plane exhibit fascinating scarred defect patterns on a sphere. Here we show that, for more general curved surfaces, curvature may be relaxed by pleats: uncharged lines of dislocations (topological dipoles) that vanish on the surface and play the same role as fabric pleats. We experimentally investigate crystal order on surfaces with spatially varying positive and negative curvature. On cylindrical capillary bridges, stretched to produce negative curvature, we observe a sequence of transitions-consistent with our energetic calculations-from no defects to isolated dislocations, which subsequently proliferate and organize into pleats; finally, scars and isolated heptagons (previously unseen) appear. This fine control of crystal order with curvature will enable explorations of general theories of defects in curved spaces. From a practical viewpoint, it may be possible to engineer structures with curvature (such as waisted nanotubes and vaulted architecture) and to develop novel methods for soft lithography and directed self-assembly.},

In single-particle tracking (SPT), one end of the polymer molecule is tethered to an immobile substratum. A microsphere attached to the other end serves as an optical marker. The conformational fluctuations of the polymer molecule can be measured by optical microscopy via the motion of the microsphere. The bead-and-spring theory for polymer dynamics is further developed to account for the microsphere, and together the measurement and the theory yield quantitative information about molecular conformations and dynamics under nonperturbing conditions. Applying the method to measurements carried out on DNA molecules provides information complementary to recent studies of single DNA molecules under extensional force. Combining high precision measurements with the theoretical analysis presented here creates a powerful tool for studying conformational dynamics of biological and synthetic macromolecules at the single-molecule level.},

The complications accompanying ensemble averaging because of random processes are greatly reduced when the object is embedded in a space of high dimensionality, d. Exact analytical expressions are presented in the case of infinite spatial dimensions, and a procedure for developing an expansion in powers of l/d is discussed for linear chain and ring-type random walks. The first two terms in such an expansion lead to results for various shape parameters that agree remarkably well with those calculated by computer simulation. The method can be extended to yield an approximate, but extremely accurate, expression for the probability distribution function directly. The theoretical approach discussed here can, in principle, be used to describe the shape of other random fractal objects as well.},

abstract = {Robust control over the positions, orientations, and assembly of nonspherical colloids may aid in the creation of new types of structured composite materials that are important from both technological and fundamental standpoints. With the use of lithographically fabricated equilateral polygonal platelets, we demonstrate that colloidal interactions and self-assembly in anisotropic nematic fluids can be effectively tailored via control over the particles' shapes. The particles disturb the uniform alignment of the surrounding nematic host, resulting in both a distinct equilibrium alignment and highly directional pair interactions. Interparticle forces between polygonal platelets exhibit either dipolar or quadrupolar symmetries, depending on whether their number of sides is odd or even, and drive the assembly of a number of ensuing self-assembled colloidal structures.},

The most significant advantages of the oscillating OT in a rheology study are: (1) very high sensitivity compared to other active microrheology methods and (2) the ability to measure both the real and imaginary components of the complex shear modulus without relying on the use of Kramers-Kronig relation, which can be problematic at low frequencies for most of the passive methods. We demonstrate the utilities of our ISMR in two case studies: (1) a 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine monolayer and (2) a composite of poly(styrene sulfonate) and dioctadecyldimethylammonium at the air/water interface in regimes where no other active instruments can explore.},

abstract = {We activated a solid-fluid interface by attaching flagellated bacteria to a solid surface. We adsorbed swarmer cells of Serratia marcescens to polydimethylsiloxane or polystyrene. The cell bodies formed a densely packed monolayer while their flagella continued to rotate freely. Motion of the fluid close to an extended flat surface, visualized with tracer beads, was dramatically enhanced compared to the motion farther away. The tracer beads revealed complex ever-changing flow patterns, some linear (rivers), others rotational (whirlpools). Typical features of this flow were small (tens of micro m) and reasonably stable (many minutes). The surface performed active mixing equivalent to diffusion with a coefficient of 2 x 10(-7) cm(2)/s. We call these flat constructs "bacterial carpets". When attached to polystyrene beads or to fragments of polydimethylsiloxane, the bacteria generated both translation and rotation. We call these constructs "auto-mobile beads" or "auto-mobile chips". Given the size and strength of the flow patterns near the carpets, the motion must be generated by small numbers of coordinated flagella. We should be able to produce larger and longer-range effects by increasing coordination.},

abstract = {A substantial school in the philosophy of science identifies Bayesian inference with inductive inference and even rationality as such, and seems to be strengthened by the rise and practical success of Bayesian statistics. We argue that the most successful forms of Bayesian statistics do not actually support that particular philosophy but rather accord much better with sophisticated forms of hypothetico-deductivism. We examine the actual role played by prior distributions in Bayesian models, and the crucial aspects of model checking and model revision, which fall outside the scope of Bayesian confirmation theory. We draw on the literature on the consistency of Bayesian updating and also on our experience of applied work in social science. Clarity about these matters should benefit not just philosophy of science, but also statistical practice. At best, the inductivist view has encouraged researchers to fit and compare models without checking them; at worst, theorists have actively discouraged practitioners from performing model checking because it does not fit into their framework.},

abstract = {Bacteria grow in either planktonic form or as biofilms, which are attached to either inert or biological surfaces. Both growth forms are highly relevant states in nature and of paramount scientific focus. However, interchanges between bacteria in these two states have been little explored. We discovered that a subpopulation of planktonic bacilli is propelled by flagella to tunnel deep within a biofilm structure. Swimmers create transient pores that increase macromolecular transfer within the biofilm. Irrigation of the biofilm by swimmer bacteria may improve biofilm bacterial fitness by increasing nutrient flow in the matrix. However, we show that the opposite may also occur (i.e., swimmers can exacerbate killing of biofilm bacteria by facilitating penetration of toxic substances from the environment). We combined these observations with the fact that numerous bacteria produce antimicrobial substances in nature. We hypothesized and proved that motile bacilli expressing a bactericide can also kill a heterologous biofilm population, Staphylococcus aureus in this case, and then occupy the newly created space. These findings identify microbial motility as a determinant of the biofilm landscape and add motility to the complement of traits contributing to rapid alterations in biofilm populations.},

Such an analysis provides important information regarding the uptake pathway and location of viruses and nanoparticles. In this review, we give an introduction into single-particle tracking (SPT) and determination of the mean-squared displacement. We also give an overview of recent advances in SPT. These include millisecond alternating-laser excitation for removal of spectral crosstalk, alternating wide-field (WF), and total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy for sensitive experiments at the plasma membrane and three-dimensional tracking strategies. Throughout the review, we highlight recent advances regarding the entry (and egress) of natural and artificial viruses obtained via SPT.},

abstract = {The particle size distribution (PSD) of a polydisperse or multimodal system can often be difficult to obtain due to the inherent limitations in established measurement techniques. For this reason, the resolution, accuracy and precision of three new and one established, commercially available and fundamentally different particle size analysis platforms were compared by measuring both individual and a mixed sample of monodisperse, sub-micron (220, 330, and 410 nm - nominal modal size) polystyrene particles. The platforms compared were the qNano Tunable Resistive Pulse Sensor, Nanosight LM10 Particle Tracking Analysis System, the CPS Instruments's UHR24000 Disc Centrifuge, and the routinely used Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS Dynamic Light Scattering system. All measurements were subjected to a peak detection algorithm so that the detected particle populations could be compared to 'reference' Transmission Electron Microscope measurements of the individual particle samples. Only the Tunable Resistive Pulse Sensor and Disc Centrifuge platforms provided the resolution required to resolve all three particle populations present in the mixed 'multimodal' particle sample. In contrast, the light scattering based Particle Tracking Analysis and Dynamic Light Scattering platforms were only able to detect a single population of particles corresponding to either the largest (410 nm) or smallest (220 nm) particles in the multimodal sample, respectively. When the particle sets were measured separately (monomodal) each platform was able to resolve and accurately obtain a mean particle size within 10\% of the Transmission Electron Microscope reference values. However, the broadness of the PSD measured in the monomodal samples deviated greatly, with coefficients of variation being \~{}2-6-fold larger than the TEM measurements across all four platforms. The large variation in the PSDs obtained from these four, fundamentally different platforms, indicates that great care must still be taken in the analysis of samples known to have complex PSDs. All of the platforms were found to have high precision, i.e. they gave rise to less than 5\% variance in PSD shape descriptors over the replicate measurements.},

abstract = {Microscope images of fluctuating biopolymers contain a wealth of information about their underlying mechanics and dynamics. However, successful extraction of this information requires precise localization of filament position and shape from thousands of noisy images. Here, we present careful measurements of the bending dynamics of filamentous (F-)actin and microtubules at thermal equilibrium with high spatial and temporal resolution using a new, simple but robust, automated image analysis algorithm with subpixel accuracy. We find that slender actin filaments have a persistence length of approximately 17 microm, and display a q(-4)-dependent relaxation spectrum, as expected from viscous drag. Microtubules have a persistence length of several millimeters; interestingly, there is a small correlation between total microtubule length and rigidity, with shorter filaments appearing softer. However, we show that this correlation can arise, in principle, from intrinsic measurement noise that must be carefully considered. The dynamic behavior of the bending of microtubules also appears more complex than that of F-actin, reflecting their higher-order structure. These results emphasize both the power and limitations of light microscopy techniques for studying the mechanics and dynamics of biopolymers.},

Although manual and semiautomatic computer-assisted image analysis are still used extensively, the demand for more reproducible and complete image measurements of complex cellular dynamics increases the need for fully automatic computational image processing approaches for both mechanistic studies and screening applications in cell biology. This chapter provides an overview of the issues that arise with the use of computational algorithms in live cell imaging studies, with particular emphasis on the close coordination of sample preparation, image acquisition, and computational image analysis. It also aims to introduce the terminology and central concepts of computer vision to facilitate the communication between cell biologists and computer scientists in collaborative imaging projects.},

@article{Braun2011,
abstract = {The cyclic tetrapyrroles, viz. chlorophylls (Chl), their bacterial analogs bacteriochlorophylls, and hemes are ubiquitous cofactors of biological catalysis that are involved in a multitude of reactions. One systematic approach for understanding how Nature achieves functional diversity with only this handful of cofactors is by designing de novo simple and robust protein scaffolds with heme and/or (bacterio)chlorophyll [(B)Chls]-binding sites. This strategy is currently mostly implemented for heme-binding proteins. To gain more insight into the factors that determine heme-/(B)Chl-binding selectivity, we explored the geometric parameters of (B)Chl-binding sites in a nonredundant subset of natural (B)Chl protein structures. Comparing our analysis to the study of a nonredundant database of heme-binding helical histidines by Negron et al. (Proteins 2009;74:400-416), we found a preference for the m-rotamer in (B)Chl-binding helical histidines, in contrast to the preferred t-rotamer in heme-binding helical histidines. This may be used for the design of specific heme- or (B)Chl-binding sites in water-soluble helical bundles, because the rotamer type defines the positioning of the bound cofactor with respect to the helix interface and thus the protein-binding site. Consensus sequences for (B)Chl binding were identified by combining a computational and database-derived approach and shown to be significantly different from the consensus sequences recommended by Negron et al. (Proteins 2009;74:400-416) for heme-binding helical proteins. The insights gained in this work on helix- (B)Chls-binding pockets provide useful guidelines for the construction of reasonable (B)Chl-binding protein templates that can be optimized by computational tools.},

It is difficult, however, to directly image atomic motion in disordered solids. We demonstrate that using aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy, we can excite and image atomic rearrangements in a two-dimensional silica glass-revealing a complex dance of elastic and plastic deformations, phase transitions, and their interplay. We identified the strain associated with individual ring rearrangements, observed the role of vacancies in shear deformation, and quantified fluctuations at a glass/liquid interface. These examples illustrate the wide-ranging and fundamental materials physics that can now be studied at atomic-resolution via transmission electron microscopy of two-dimensional glasses.},

One major limitation to understanding biofilm formation and development is the accurate measurement of bacterial cell adhesion to hydrophobic interfaces. With this study, bacterial attachment and biofilm growth over time at water-oil interface was monitored through interfacial rheology and tensiometry. Five model bacteria (Pseudomonas putida KT2442, Pseudomonas putida W2, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, and Bacillus subtilis) were allowed to adsorb at the water-oil interface either in their non-growing or growing state. We found that we were able to observe the initial kinetics of bacterial attachment and the transient biofilm formation at the water-oil interface through interfacial rheology and tensiometry. Electrophoretic mobility measurements and bacterial adhesion to hydrocarbons (BATH) tests were performed to characterize the selected bacteria. To validate interfacial rheology and tensiometry measurements, we monitored biofilm formation utilizing both confocal laser scanning microscopy and light microscopy. Using this combination of techniques, we were able to observe the elasticity and tension development over time, from the first bacterial attachment up to biofilm formation.},

abstract = {Water-oil emulsions occur throughout oil production, transportation, and processing. The breaking of the water/oil emulsion improves oil quality and as a consequence chemically synthesized de-emulsifiers are commonly used in the petroleum industries. Microbial de-emulsifiers represent potential alternatives to the chemicals and may become important products for petroleum industries. The main goal of this work was isolation, identification, and characterization of an efficient de-emulsifying bacterium. Following a multi-step enrichment programme a de-emulsifying bacterium, Ochrobactrum anthropi strain RIPI5-1was isolated from the oil-polluted sandy bank of Siri Island, Iran. The presence of an oil phase in growth medium was found to be unnecessary for production of the de-emulsifier. The de-emulsifying activity of both the whole culture and the cells of this strain was examined using a model multiple water-crude oil (w/o/w) emulsion. This w/o/w emulsion was used for the first time in microbial de-emulsification research. Whole cells of strain RIPI5-1 exhibited high de-emulsifying activity during the late-exponential growth and stationary phases; de-emulsifying activity of the whole culture was highest during the early-exponential growth phase. The time course of de-emulsification by whole culture and whole cells of strain RIPI5-1 was investigated; the initial rate (DeI(1)) of breaking of the multiple water-crude oil emulsion by whole culture and whole cells was calculated as 11\% and 54\%, respectively. However, overall de-emulsification (DeI(8.5)) for whole culture and whole cells was calculated as 63\% and 72\%, respectively. A clear correlation was observed between cell surface hydrophobicity and the de-emulsifying activity of whole cells. With the water/kerosene emulsion, emulsion half-life (t(1/2)) was found to be <0.5h. The potential activity of this strain was also explained using a complex oilfield emulsion.},

We performed a panel of interfacial rheological measurements during biofilm formation at the air-liquid interface by the Escherichia coli strain UTI89, which is noted for its importance in studies of urinary tract infection and for its assembly of functional amyloid fibers termed curli. Brewster-angle microscopy and measurements of the surface elasticity (G(s)') and stress-strain response provided sensitive and quantitative parameters that revealed distinct stages during bacterial colonization, aggregation, and eventual formation of a pellicle at the air-liquid interface. Pellicles that formed under conditions that upregulate curli production exhibited an increase in strength and viscoelastic properties as well as a greater ability to recover from stress-strain perturbation. The results suggest that curli, as hydrophobic extracellular amyloid fibers, enhance the strength, viscoelasticity, and resistance to strain of E. coli biofilms formed at the air-liquid interface.},

abstract = {Mucus is a complex biological material that lubricates and protects the human lungs, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, vagina, eyes, and other moist mucosal surfaces. Mucus serves as a physical barrier against foreign particles, including toxins, pathogens, and environmental ultrafine particles, while allowing rapid passage of selected gases, ions, nutrients, and many proteins. Its selective barrier properties are precisely regulated at the biochemical level across vastly different length scales. At the macroscale, mucus behaves as a non-Newtonian gel, distinguished from classical solids and liquids by its response to shear rate and shear stress, while, at the nanoscale, it behaves as a low viscosity fluid. Advances in the rheological characterization of mucus from the macroscopic to nanoscopic levels have contributed critical understanding to mucus physiology, disease pathology, and the development of drug delivery systems designed for use at mucosal surfaces. This article reviews the biochemistry that governs mucus rheology, the macro- and microrheology of human and laboratory animal mucus, rheological techniques applied to mucus, and the importance of an improved understanding of the physical properties of mucus to advancing the field of drug and gene delivery.},

Here I review several interrelated areas of recent work on aqueous systems that aim to explore and explain this richness by revealing molecular arrangements, their thermodynamic origins, and the timescales on which they change. Vibrational spectroscopy of OH stretching features prominently in these discussions, with an emphasis on efforts to establish connections between spectroscopic signals and statistics of intermolecular structure. For bulk solutions, the results of these efforts largely verify and enrich existing physical pictures of hydrogen-bond network connectivity, dynamics, and response. For water at interfaces, such pictures are still emerging. As an important example I discuss the solvation of small ions at the air-water interface, whose surface propensities challenge a basic understanding of how aqueous fluctuations accommodate solutes in heterogeneous environments.},

abstract = {We investigate the surface viscoelasticity of beta-lactoglobulin and beta-casein spread surface monolayers using a recently discovered method. Step compressions are performed, and the surface pressure is measured as a function of time. This is a common experiment for surface monolayers. However in our experiments the pressure is recorded by two perpendicular sensors, parallel and perpendicular to the compression direction. This enables us to clearly measure the time relaxation of both the compression and shear moduli, at the same time, in a single experiment, and with a standard apparatus. beta-Lactoglobulin and beta-casein monolayers are interesting because of their importance in food science and because they exhibit universally slow dynamical behavior that is still not fully understood. Our results confirm that the compressional modulus dominates the total viscoelastic response in both proteins. Indeed for beta-casein we confirm that the shear modulus is always negligible, i.e., the layer is in a fluid state. In beta-lactoglobulin a finite shear modulus emerges above a critical concentration. We emphasize that in Langmuir trough dynamic experiments the surface pressure should be measured in both the compression and the perpendicular directions.},

abstract = {A review of the structure and some properties of condensed phases of water is given. Since the discovery of the polymorphism of crystalline ice (beginning of the twentieth century), 15 ice modifications have been found and their structures have been determined. If we do not take into consideration proton ordering or disordering, nine distinct crystalline ice modifications in which water molecules retain their individuality are known. In the tenth, ice X, there are no H(2)O molecules. It contains ions (or atoms) of oxygen and hydrogen. The structure of all these modifications is described and information about their fields of stability and about the transition between them is given. It is emphasized that there are ice modifications which are metastable at any temperature and pressure (ices Ic, IV and XII), and many modifications can exist as metastable phases beyond their fields of stability. The ability of water to exist in metastable states is one of its remarkable properties. Several amorphous ice modifications (all of them are metastable) are known. Brief information about their properties and transitions between them is given. At the end of the 1960s the conception of the water structure as a three-dimensional hydrogen-bonded network was conclusively formed. Discovery of the polymorphism of amorphous ices awakened interest in the heterogeneity of the water network. Structural and dynamical heterogeneity of liquid water is discussed in detail. Computer simulation showed that the diffusion coefficient of water molecules in dense regions of the network is lower than in the loose regions, while an increase of density of the entire network gives rise to an increase of diffusion coefficient. This finding contradicts the conceptions associated with the primitive two-state models and can be explained from pressure dependences of melting temperature and of homogeneous nucleation temperature. A brief discussion of the picture of molecular motions in liquid water based on experiment and on computer simulation is given. This picture is still very incomplete. The most fascinating idea that was put forward during the last 20 years was the second critical point conjecture. It is still not clear whether this conjecture corresponds to reality.},

abstract = {Methods to extract information from the tracking of mobile objects/particles have broad interest in biological and physical sciences. Techniques based on simple criteria of proximity in time-consecutive snapshots are useful to identify the trajectories of the particles. However, they become problematic as the motility and/or the density of the particles increases due to uncertainties on the trajectories that particles followed during the images' acquisition time. Here, we report an efficient method for learning parameters of the dynamics of the particles from their positions in time-consecutive images. Our algorithm belongs to the class of message-passing algorithms, known in computer science, information theory, and statistical physics as belief propagation (BP). The algorithm is distributed, thus allowing parallel implementation suitable for computations on multiple machines without significant intermachine overhead. We test our method on the model example of particle tracking in turbulent flows, which is particularly challenging due to the strong transport that those flows produce. Our numerical experiments show that the BP algorithm compares in quality with exact Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms, yet BP is far superior in speed. We also suggest and analyze a random distance model that provides theoretical justification for BP accuracy. Methods developed here systematically formulate the problem of particle tracking and provide fast and reliable tools for the model's extensive range of applications.},

abstract = {We investigate the motion of ferromagnetic nanowires confined to nanometer-scale oil films at an air/aqueous interface in response to the application of external magnetic fields and field gradients. By varying the oil viscosity, film thickness, and wire length, we cover two regimes of response suggested by theory: one where the surface viscosity is expected to dominate the wire's motion and one where the subphase viscosity is expected to dominate [Levine, A. J.; Liverpool, T. B.; MacKintosh, F. C. Phys. Rev. E 2004, 69, 021503]. For wire motion parallel to the long axis of the wire, the observed drag agrees reasonably with theoretical predictions. However, the drag on wires moving perpendicular to their long axis or rotating about a short axis is unexpectedly insensitive to the film properties over the full range of measurements. This behavior is in contrast to the rotational and translational drag on nanowires in molecularly thin protein layers, which follow theoretical expectations. The observations in the oil films, which are explained in terms of the manner in which the wire immerses dynamically in the film and subphase, demonstrate how the effective drag viscosity of an aspherical particle confined to a fluid interface can depend on its direction of motion.},

Laboratory observations indicate that biofilms are viscoelastic materials. Likewise, current knowledge of biofilm internal structure suggests modeling biofilms as associated polymer viscoelastic systems. Supporting experimental results and a system of viscoelastic fluid equations with a linear Jeffreys viscoelastic stress-strain law are presented here. This system of equations is based on elements of associated polymer physics and is also consistent with presented and previous experimental results. A number of predictions can be made. One particularly interesting result is the prediction of an elastic relaxation time on the order of a few minutes-biofilm disturbances on shorter time scales produce an elastic response, biofilm disturbances on longer time scales result in viscous flow, i.e., nonreversible biofilm deformation. Although not previously recognized, evidence of this phenomenon is in fact present in recent experimental results.},

abstract = {Employing frequency-dependent dielectric susceptibility we characterize the aging in two supercooled liquids, sorbitol and xylitol, below their calorimetric glass transition temperatures. In addition to the alpha relaxation that tracks the structural dynamics, the susceptibility of both liquids possesses a secondary Johari-Goldstein relaxation at higher frequencies. Following a quench through the glass transition, the susceptibility slowly approaches the equilibrium behavior. For both liquids, the magnitude of the Johari-Goldstein relaxation displays a dependence on the time since the quench, or aging time, that is quantitatively very similar to the age dependence of the alpha peak frequency. The Johari-Goldstein relaxation time remains constant during aging for sorbitol while it decreases slightly with age for xylitol. Hence, one cannot sensibly assign a fictive temperature to the Johari-Goldstein relaxation. This behavior contrasts with that of liquids lacking distinct Johari-Goldstein peaks for which the excess wing of the alpha peak tracks the main part of the peak during aging, enabling the assignment of a single fictive temperature to the entire spectrum. The aging behavior of the Johari-Goldstein relaxation time further calls into question the possibility that the relaxation time possesses stronger temperature dependence in equilibrium than is observed in the out-of-equilibrium state below the glass transition.},

abstract = {Microbes inhabiting Earth have adapted to diverse environments of water, air, soil, and often at the interfaces of multiple media. In this study, we focus on the behavior of Caulobacter crescentus, a singly flagellated bacterium, at the air/water interface. Forward swimming C. crescentus swarmer cells tend to get physically trapped at the surface when swimming in nutrient-rich growth medium but not in minimal salt motility medium. Trapped cells move in tight, clockwise circles when viewed from the air with slightly reduced speed. Trace amounts of Triton X100, a nonionic surfactant, release the trapped cells from these circular trajectories. We show, by tracing the motion of positively charged colloidal beads near the interface that organic molecules in the growth medium adsorb at the interface, creating a high viscosity film. Consequently, the air/water interface no longer acts as a free surface and forward swimming cells become hydrodynamically trapped. Added surfactants efficiently partition to the surface, replacing the viscous layer of molecules and reestablishing free surface behavior. These findings help explain recent similar studies on Escherichia coli, showing trajectories of variable handedness depending on media chemistry. The consistent behavior of these two distinct microbial species provides insights on how microbes have evolved to cope with challenging interfacial environments.},

abstract = {The effect of pH on the adsorption of catalase and lysozyme at the air-water interface has been studied using a combined surface pressure-interfacial shear rheology technique. The results presented show that the rate of development of interfacial phenomena increases as the pH of the subphase approaches the isoelectric point of the protein under investigation. The development of the measured interfacial rheological parameters is due to an increased rate of cross-link formation within the resultant interfacial gel. The formation of the interfacial gels has been modeled using a combination of the Smoluchowski theory for the coagulation of an aerosol or fog and classic rubber elasticity theory. The enhanced rate of cross-link formation at the isoelectric point is a result of an in-surface phase separation brought about by cooperative deionization of the protein molecules near their isoelectric point. Simultaneous measurements of surface pressure and interfacial rheology have enabled us to show that the development of a gel-like interfacial network coincides with observed increases in surface pressure.},

@article{Fuller2012,
abstract = {Complex fluid-fluid interfaces are common to living systems, foods, personal products, and the environment. They occur wherever surface-active molecules and particles collect at fluid interfaces and render them nonlinear in their response to flow and deformation. When this occurs, the interfaces acquire a complex microstructure that must be interrogated. Interfacial rheological material properties must be measured to appreciate their role in such varied processes as lung function, cell division, and foam and emulsion stability. This review presents the methods that have been devised to determine the microstructure of complex fluid-fluid interfaces. Complex interfacial microstructure leads to rheological complexity. This behavior is often responsible for stabilizing interfacial systems such as foams and emulsions, and it can also have a profound influence on wetting/dewetting dynamics. Interfacial rheological characterization relies on the development of tools with the sensitivity to respond to small surface stresses in a way that isolates them from bulk stresses. This development is relatively recent, and reviews of methods for both shear and dilatational measurements are offered here.},

Here we establish the basic principles of particle-tracking microrheology, describing the advantages of this approach over more conventional approaches to cell mechanics. We present basic concepts of molecular mechanics and polymer physics relevant to the microrheological response of cells. Particle-tracking microrheology can probe the mechanical properties of live cells in experimentally difficult, yet more physiological, environments, including cells embedded inside a 3D matrix, adherent cells subjected to shear flows, and cells inside a developing embryo. Particle-tracking microrheology can readily reveal the lost ability of diseased cells to resist shear forces.},

The time dependence of the density profile at the air/water interface revealed that the molecular conformation changed significantly during adsorption. Taking into account previous work using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, we propose that the LSZ molecules initially adsorbed on the air/water interface have a flat unfolded structure, forming antiparallel beta-sheets as a result of hydrophobic interactions with the gas phase. In contrast, as adsorption continues, a second layer forms in which the molecules have a very loose structure having random coils as a result of hydrophilic interactions with the hydrophilic groups that protrude from the first layer.},

Determination of molecule positions with high accuracy and correct connection of the determined positions to tracks is a challenging task with, so far, no universal solution for single fluorescing molecules tackling the challenge of low signal-to-noise ratios, frequent blinking and photo bleaching. Thus, the development of novel algorithms for automatic single molecule fluorescence tracking is essential to analyse the huge amount of diffusional data obtained with single molecule widefield fluorescence microscopy. Here, we present a novel tracking model using a top-down polyhedral approach which can be implemented effectively using standard linear programming solvers. The results of our tracking approach are compared to the ground truth of simulated data with different diffusion coefficients, signal-to-noise ratios and particle densities. We also determine the dependency of blinking on the analysed distribution of diffusion coefficients. To confirm the functionality of our tracking method, the results of automatic tracking and manual tracking by a human expert are compared and discussed.},

abstract = {Cells respond to mechanical forces whether applied externally or generated internally via the cytoskeleton. To study the cellular response to forces separately, we applied external forces to cells via microfabricated magnetic posts containing cobalt nanowires interspersed among an array of elastomeric posts, which acted as independent sensors to cellular traction forces. A magnetic field induced torque in the nanowires, which deflected the magnetic posts and imparted force to individual adhesions of cells attached to the array. Using this system, we examined the cellular reaction to applied forces and found that applying a step force led to an increase in local focal adhesion size at the site of application but not at nearby nonmagnetic posts. Focal adhesion recruitment was enhanced further when cells were subjected to multiple force actuations within the same time interval. Recording the traction forces in response to such force stimulation revealed two responses: a sudden loss in contractility that occurred within the first minute of stimulation or a gradual decay in contractility over several minutes. For both types of responses, the subcellular distribution of loss in traction forces was not confined to locations near the actuated micropost, nor uniformly across the whole cell, but instead occurred at discrete locations along the cell periphery. Together, these data reveal an important dynamic biological relationship between external and internal forces and demonstrate the utility of this microfabricated system to explore this interaction.},

abstract = {Biofilms grow on various surfaces and in many different environments, a phenomenon that constitutes major problems in industry and medicine. Despite their importance little is known about the viscoelastic properties of biofilms and how these depend on the chemical microenvironment. Here, we find that the mechanical properties of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P.a.) biofilms are highly robust towards chemical perturbations. Specifically, we observe that P.a. biofilms are able to fully regain their initial stiffness after yielding is enforced, even in the presence of chemicals. Moreover, only trivalent ions and citric acid significantly affect the biofilm elasticity, the first of which also alter the texture of the material. Finally, our results indicate that biofilm mechanics and bacteria viability inside the biofilm are not necessarily linked which suggests that targeting bacteria alone might not be sufficient for biofilm removal strategies.},

abstract = {In this article we present methods for measuring hindered Brownian motion in the confinement of complex 3D geometries using digital video microscopy. Here we discuss essential features of automated 3D particle tracking as well as diffusion data analysis. By introducing local mean squared displacement-vs-time curves, we are able to simultaneously measure the spatial dependence of diffusion coefficients, tracking accuracies and drift velocities. Such local measurements allow a more detailed and appropriate description of strongly heterogeneous systems as opposed to global measurements. Finite size effects of the tracking region on measuring mean squared displacements are also discussed. The use of these methods was crucial for the measurement of the diffusive behavior of spherical polystyrene particles (505 nm diameter) in a microfluidic chip. The particles explored an array of parallel channels with different cross sections as well as the bulk reservoirs. For this experiment we present the measurement of local tracking accuracies in all three axial directions as well as the diffusivity parallel to the channel axis while we observed no significant flow but purely Brownian motion. Finally, the presented algorithm is suitable also for tracking of fluorescently labeled particles and particles driven by an external force, e.g., electrokinetic or dielectrophoretic forces.},

abstract = {Although human musical performances represent one of the most valuable achievements of mankind, the best musicians perform imperfectly. Musical rhythms are not entirely accurate and thus inevitably deviate from the ideal beat pattern. Nevertheless, computer generated perfect beat patterns are frequently devalued by listeners due to a perceived lack of human touch. Professional audio editing software therefore offers a humanizing feature which artificially generates rhythmic fluctuations. However, the built-in humanizing units are essentially random number generators producing only simple uncorrelated fluctuations. Here, for the first time, we establish long-range fluctuations as an inevitable natural companion of both simple and complex human rhythmic performances. Moreover, we demonstrate that listeners strongly prefer long-range correlated fluctuations in musical rhythms. Thus, the favorable fluctuation type for humanizing interbeat intervals coincides with the one generically inherent in human musical performances.},

The reaction proceeded in two stages; insulin stability was enhanced at higher concentration. Mathematical modeling of proposed kinetic schemes was employed to identify possible reaction pathways and to explain greater stability at higher insulin concentration.},

abstract = {The adsorption data presented in the preceding paper (Part II of this series) have been used to deduce the molecular structures of $\beta$-casein, bovine serum albumin (BSA), and lysozyme films at the air-water and oil-water interfaces. The hydrophobic, disordered $\beta$-casein molecules are more surface-active than the globular BSA and lysozyme molecules. $\beta$-Casein is in an all-train configuration at low surface pressures ($\pi$ < 8 mN m−1) at the air-water interface and can be described by Singer's equation of state for linear polymers. At higher $\pi$ values, loop formation ensues, and the loops increase in density at the expense of the trains until in the close-packed, condensed state the ratio of amino acid residues in loop and train configurations is about 2:1. This conformational change does not occur at the oil-water interface because loops already form at low $\pi$; enhanced loop formation in the nonaqueous phase is favored because oil molecules solvate the hydrophobic residues. Multilayer formation occurs at high substrate protein concentrations (> 10−2 wt\%) giving films thicker than 100 \AA. Although the primary layer is irreversibly adsorbed, molecules in subsequent layers are reversibly adsorbed. Lysozyme molecules are denatured at low $\pi$ values ($\pi$ < 8 mN m−1), and at higher values essentially native molecules (which are reversibly adsorbed) coexist in the surface film. Much residual native structure remains even in the denatured film because lysozyme is very resistant to denaturation. At the oil-water interface, the adsorbed lysozyme molecules are denatured to a greater extent than those at the air-water interface; native molecules are not stable at this interface. The adsorbed BSA molecules contain residual native structure, but there is no abrupt conformational change in the film at a particular packing density. The structure at the air-water interface is intermediate to those of lysozyme and $\beta$-casein. BSA has the same $\pi$-A curve as lysozyme at the oil-water interface.},

abstract = {Most bacteria live in the form of adherent communities forming three-dimensional material anchored to artificial or biological surfaces, with profound impact on many human activities. Biofilms are recognized as complex systems but their physical properties have been mainly studied from a macroscopic perspective. To determine biofilm local mechanical properties, reveal their potential heterogeneity, and investigate their relation to molecular traits, we have developed a seemingly new microrheology approach based on magnetic particle infiltration in growing biofilms. Using magnetic tweezers, we achieved what was, to our knowledge, the first three-dimensional mapping of the viscoelastic parameters on biofilms formed by the bacterium Escherichia coli. We demonstrate that its mechanical profile may exhibit elastic compliance values spread over three orders of magnitude in a given biofilm. We also prove that heterogeneity strongly depends on external conditions such as growth shear stress. Using strains genetically engineered to produce well-characterized cell surface adhesins, we show that the mechanical profile of biofilm is exquisitely sensitive to the expression of different surface appendages such as F pilus or curli. These results provide a quantitative view of local mechanical properties within intact biofilms and open up an additional avenue for elucidating the emergence and fate of the different microenvironments within these living materials.},

Techniques capable of measuring the size and concentration of membrane vesicles directly in biofluids are urgently needed. Fluorescence single particle tracking microscopy has the potential of doing exactly that by labelling the membrane vesicles with a fluorescent label and analysing their Brownian motion in the biofluid. However, an unbound dye in the biofluid can cause high background intensity that strongly biases the fluorescence single particle tracking size and concentration measurements. While such background intensity can be avoided with light sheet illumination, current set-ups require specialty sample holders that are not compatible with high-throughput diagnostics. Here, a microfluidic chip with integrated light sheet illumination is reported, and accurate fluorescence single particle tracking size and concentration measurements of membrane vesicles in cell culture medium and in interstitial fluid collected from primary human breast tumours are demonstrated.},

abstract = {A clot's function is to achieve hemostasis by resisting fluid flow. Permeability is the measurement of a clot's hemostatic potential. It is sensitive to a wide range of biochemical parameters and pathologies. In this work, we consider the hydrodynamic phenomenon that reduces the mobility of fluid near the fiber surfaces. This no-slip boundary condition both defines the gel's permeability and suppresses nanoparticle diffusion in gel interstices. Here we report that, unlike previous work where steric effects also hindered diffusion, our system-nanoparticles in fibrin gel-was subject exclusively to hydrodynamic diffusion suppression. This result enabled an automated, high-throughput permeability assay that used small clot volumes. Permeability was derived from nanoparticle diffusion using the effective medium theory, and showed one-to-one correlation with measured permeability. This technique measured permeability without quantifying gel structure, and may therefore prove useful for characterizing similar materials (e.g., extracellular matrix) where structure is uncontrolled during polymerization and difficult to measure subsequently. We also report that PEGylation reduced, but did not eliminate, the population of immobile particles. We studied the forces required to pull stuck PEG particles free to confirm that the attachment is a result of neither covalent nor strong electrostatic binding, and discuss the relevance of this force scale to particle transport through physiological clots.},

abstract = {Anomalous diffusion has been widely observed by single particle tracking microscopy in complex systems such as biological cells. The resulting time series are usually evaluated in terms of time averages. Often anomalous diffusion is connected with non-ergodic behaviour. In such cases the time averages remain random variables and hence irreproducible. Here we present a detailed analysis of the time averaged mean squared displacement for systems governed by anomalous diffusion, considering both unconfined and restricted (corralled) motion. We discuss the behaviour of the time averaged mean squared displacement for two prominent stochastic processes, namely, continuous time random walks and fractional Brownian motion. We also study the distribution of the time averaged mean squared displacement around its ensemble mean, and show that this distribution preserves typical process characteristics even for short time series. Recently, velocity correlation functions were suggested to distinguish between these processes. We here present analytical expressions for the velocity correlation functions. The knowledge of the results presented here is expected to be relevant for the correct interpretation of single particle trajectory data in complex systems.},

abstract = {Single-particle tracking (SPT) is widely used to study processes from membrane receptor organization to the dynamics of RNAs in living cells. While single-dye labeling strategies have the benefit of being minimally invasive, this comes at the expense of data quality; typically a data set of short trajectories is obtained and analyzed by means of the mean square displacements (MSD) or the distribution of the particles' displacements in a set time interval (jump distance, JD). To evaluate the applicability of both approaches, a quantitative comparison of both methods under typically encountered experimental conditions is necessary. Here we use Monte Carlo simulations to systematically compare the accuracy of diffusion coefficients (D-values) obtained for three cases: one population of diffusing species, two populations with different D-values, and a population switching between two D-values. For the first case we find that the MSD gives more or equally accurate results than the JD analysis (relative errors of D-values <6\%). If two diffusing species are present or a particle undergoes a motion change, the JD analysis successfully distinguishes both species (relative error <5\%). Finally we apply the JD analysis to investigate the motion of endogenous LPS receptors in live macrophages before and after treatment with methyl-$\beta$-cyclodextrin and latrunculin B.},

abstract = {Anisotropic particles suspended in a nematic liquid crystal disturb the alignment of the liquid crystal molecules and experience small forces that depend on the particles' orientation. We have measured these forces using magnetic nanowires. The torque on a wire and its orientation-dependent repulsion from a flat surface are quantitatively consistent with theoretical predictions based on the elastic properties of the liquid crystal. These forces can also be used to manipulate submicrometer-scale particles. We show that controlled spatial variations in the liquid crystal's alignment convert the torque on a wire to a translational force that levitates the wire to a specified height.},

abstract = {Proteins and low molecular weight (LMW) surfactants are widely used for the physical stabilisation of many emulsions and foam based food products. The formation and stabilisation of these emulsions and foams depend strongly on the interfacial properties of the proteins and the LMW surfactants. Therefore these properties have been studied extensively. In this review an overview is given of interfacial properties of proteins at a mesoscopic scale and the effect of LMW surfactants (emulsifiers) on them. Properties addressed are the adsorbed amount, surface tension (reduction), network formation at interfaces and possible conformational changes during and after adsorption. Special attention is given to interfacial rheological behaviour of proteins at expanding and compressing interfaces, which simulate the behaviour in real emulsions and foams. It will be illustrated that information on interfacial rheological properties, protein conformation and interactions between adsorbed molecules can be obtained by changing experimental conditions. The relation between interfacial rheology and emulsion and foam stabilisation is subsequently addressed. It is concluded that there is a need for new measuring devices that monitor several interfacial properties on a mesoscopic and microscopic scale at the same time, and for physical models describing the various processes of importance for proteins. Real progress will only be possible if both are combined in an innovative way.},

By this approach it is possible to observe single fluorescent biomolecules in solution, living cells and even tissue with an unprecedented speed and signal-to-noise ratio deep within the sample. Thereby we could directly observe and track small and large tracer molecules in aqueous solution. Furthermore, we demonstrated the feasibility to visualize the dynamics of single tracer molecules and native messenger ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs) in salivary gland cell nuclei of Chironomus tentans larvae up to 200 microm within the specimen with an excellent signal quality. Thus single molecule light sheet based fluorescence microscopy allows analyzing molecular diffusion and interactions in complex biological systems.},

@article{Hohne2009,
abstract = {We introduce a flexible microfluidic device to characterize the mechanical properties of soft viscoelastic solids such as bacterial biofilms. In the device, stress is imposed on a test specimen by the application of a fixed pressure to a thin, flexible poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS) membrane that is in contact with the specimen. The stress is applied by pressurizing a microfabricated air channel located above the test area. The strain resulting from the applied stress is quantified by measuring the membrane deflection with a confocal laser scanning microscope. The deflection is governed by the viscoelastic properties of the PDMS membrane and of the test specimen. The relative contributions of the membrane and test material to the measured deformation are quantified by comparing a finite element analysis with an independent (control) measurement of the PDMS membrane mechanical properties. The flexible microfluidic rheometer was used to characterize both the steady-state elastic modulus and the transient strain recoil of two soft materials: gellan gums and bacterial biofilms. The measured linear elastic moduli and viscoelastic relaxation times of gellan gum solutions were in good agreement with the results of conventional mechanical rheometry. The linear Young's moduli of biofilms of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Klebsiella pneumoniae, which could not be measured using conventional methods, were found to be 3.2 and 1.1 kPa, respectively, and the relaxation time of the S. epidermidis biofilm was 13.8 s. Additionally, strain hardening was observed in all the biofilms studied. Finally, design parameters and detection limits of the method show that the device is capable of characterizing soft viscoelastic solids with elastic moduli in the range of 102-105 Pa. The flexible microfluidic rheometer addresses the need for mechanical property characterization of soft viscoelastic solids common in fields such as biomaterials, food, and consumer products. It requires only 200 pL of the test specimen.},

abstract = {Hydrophobic bacteria, like colloidal solids, can spontaneously adsorb onto fluid-fluid interfaces and modify their mechanical properties. In this study, two strains of bacteria--Acinetobacter venetianus RAG-1 and Rhodococcus erythropolis 20S-E1-c--were prepared in their stationary (i.e. non-dividing) phase in the absence of biosurfactants; the cells were then used as emulsifiers to stabilize n-hexadecane droplets in aqueous environments. Using the micropipette technique, colloidal stability of the bacteria-coated droplets was examined through direct-contact experiments. Both types of bacteria were seen to function as effective stabilizers, although the Acinetobacter venetianus RAG-1 film provided stronger resistance to droplet-droplet coalescence. In addition to creating steric barriers, the adsorbed bacteria also interacted with one another at the interface, giving rise to higher order rheological properties. A technique of directly probing the mechanical properties of the emulsion drop surfaces (i.e. the adsorbed films) on the micrometre-scale revealed that (a) the films behaved as purely elastic sheets, and (b) with a reduction in cell concentration in the aqueous phase, less oil was emulsified, but the elastic moduli of the adsorbed films remained unchanged (suggesting an "all or none" adsorption process). These results are in contrast to a previous macroscopic (i.e. millimetre-scale) study, which showed that the absorbed films were viscoelastic, with the apparent elastic moduli depending strongly on cell concentration. The rheological properties of these bacteria-adsorbed interfaces appeared therefore to be length scale-dependent.},

abstract = {In this study, the mobility of nanoparticles in mucus and similar hydrogels as model systems was assessed to elucidate the link between microscopic diffusion behavior and macroscopic penetration of such gels. Differences in particle adhesion to mucus components were strongly dependent on particle coating. Particles coated with 2 kDa PEG exhibited a decreased adhesion to mucus components, whereas chitosan strongly increased the adhesion. Despite such mucoinert properties of PEG, magnetic nanoparticles of both coatings did not penetrate through native respiratory mucus, resisting high magnetic forces (even for several hours). However, model hydrogels were, indeed, penetrated by both particles in dependency of particle coating, obeying the theory of particle mobility in an external force field. Comparison of penetration data with cryogenic scanning EM images of mucus and the applied model systems suggested particularly high rigidity of the mucin scaffold and a broad pore size distribution in mucus as reasons for the observed particle immobilization. Active probing of the rigidity of mucus and model gels with optical tweezers was used in this context to confirm such properties of mucus on the microscale, thus presenting the missing link between micro- and macroscopical observations. Because of high heterogeneity in the size of the voids and pores in mucus, on small scales, particle mobility will depend on adhesive or inert properties. However, particle translocation over distances larger than a few micrometers is restricted by highly rigid structures within the mucus mesh.},

abstract = {Swarming bacteria move on agar surfaces in groups, using flagella as motive organelles. Motility depends critically on surface wetness, which is enabled by osmotic agents and surfactants secreted by the bacteria. In a recent study, the upper surface of an Escherichia coli swarm was found to be stationary, as determined from the motion of MgO particles deposited on the swarm. This led to the remarkable conclusion that the bacteria move between two stationary surfaces-the agar gel below and the liquid/air interface above. That study suggested that secreted surfactants may contribute to immobilizing the upper surface of a swarm. Here, we test this proposition using two robust surfactant-producing bacteria. We find antithetically that the upper surfaces of both these swarms are mobile, showing a superdiffusive behavior in swarms with stronger surfactant activity. Superdiffusive behavior was not observed on the surface of a drop of bacterial culture, on bacteria-free culture supernatant, or on nonswarming surfactant-producer colonies, which suggests that superdiffusion is an emergent property resulting from the interaction of the collective motion of the bacteria within the swarm with the surfactant layer above. Swarming not only allows bacteria to forage for food, but also confers protective advantages against antimicrobial agents. Our results are therefore relevant to superdiffusive strategies in biological foraging and survival.},

Little definite is known, however, about how stress propagates through diVerent cell structures or how it is converted to biochemical signals via mechanotransduction, due in large part to the diYculty of interpreting many cell mechanics experiments. A newly developed technique, two-point microrheology (TPM), can provide highly interpretable, quantitative measurements of cells’ frequency-dependent shearmoduli and spectra of their fluctuating intracellular stres- ses.TPMis a noninvasive method based on measuring the Brownianmotion of large numbers of intracellular particles using multiple-particle tracking. While requiring only hardware available in many cell biology laboratories, a phase microscope and digital video camera, as a statistical technique, it also requires the automated analysis of many thousands of micrographs. Here we describe in detail the algorithms and software tools used for such large-scalemultiple-particle tracking as well as common sourcesof errorandthemicroscopymethodsneeded tominimize them.Moreover,we describe the physical principles behind TPM and other passive microrheological methods, their limitations, and typical results for cultured epithelial cells.},

@article{King-Smith2000,
abstract = {PURPOSE: Interferometric methods have considerable potential for studying the thickness of layers of the human tear film and cornea because of their ability to make noninvasive, accurate, and rapid measurements. However, previous interferometric studies by Prydal and Danjo yielded tear thickness values near 40 and 11 microm, respectively, considerably greater than estimates made by invasive methods of 4 to 8 microm. Using a modified version of Danjo's method, interference effects from the tear film and cornea were studied, with the aim of correlation with known structure and optical properties of the cornea and hence determining the most probable value of tear film thickness.

METHODS: Reflectance spectra from the human cornea were measured at normal incidence. These spectra show oscillations whose maxima correspond to constructive interference between light reflected from the air surface and from some deeper surface. The frequency of these spectral oscillations is proportional to the thickness of the layer between the air surface and the second surface. Therefore, Fourier analysis of reflectance spectra can be used to determine the thickness of layers of the tear film and cornea. In the main experiment, 36 low-resolution spectra were obtained from six normal eyes for measuring thickness up to 100 microm. Control experiments included measurements of the time course of thickness changes and high-resolution spectra for measuring thickness up to 1000 microm.

RESULTS: For the main experiment, in the thickness range 1 to 100 microm, the strongest peak in the Fourier transform was near 3 microm (range, 1.5-4.7 microm) beneath the air surface. In the range 20 to 100 microm, the strongest peak was near 55 microm (range, 50-59 microm) for all 36 spectra; none were in Prydal's range near 40 microm. This 55-microm peak is consistent with a reflection from the basement membrane of the epithelium. Time course measurements after a blink show that the 3-microm peak is not an artifact. High-resolution spectra gave a peak near 510 microm, corresponding to the complete thickness of the cornea (plus tear film). This peak had a contrast similar to that of the 3-microm peak.

CONCLUSIONS: These studies did not confirm Prydal's estimate of approximately 40 microm. Nor were there prominent peaks near Danjo's value of approximately 11 microm, except in cases of probable reflex tears. Because the reflection at the aqueous-mucus boundary would be expected to be weaker than that from the epithelial surface, the 3-microm peak is unlikely to correspond to the aqueous layer (rather than the complete tear film). The proposal that the 3-microm peak corresponds to a reflection from the front of the cornea is supported by the demonstration of a peak of similar contrast from the back of the cornea. Thus, the current evidence consistently supports a value of approximately 3 microm for the thickness of the human precorneal tear film.},

In a subgroup of 87 subjects, MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and magnetoencephalography studies demonstrated a strong neural basis for both types of pitch perception irrespective of musical aptitude. Compared with f0 listeners, fSP listeners possessed a pronounced rightward, rather than leftward, asymmetry of gray matter volume and P50m activity within the pitch-sensitive lateral Heschl's gyrus. Our data link relative hemispheric lateralization with perceptual stimulus properties, whereas the absolute size of the Heschl's gyrus depends on musical aptitude.},

Gaussian mixture modeling, currently the most common approach, has several drawbacks, such as reliance on a Gaussian model and iterative local optimization used to estimate the model parameters. It also does not take advantage of substantially larger amount of data provided by 3D acquisitions, which are becoming standard in clinical environment. We propose a novel and completely non-parametric algorithm to estimate the tissue intensity probabilities in 3D images. Instead of relying on traditional framework of iterating between classification and estimation, we pose the problem as an instance of a blind source separation problem, where the unknown distributions are treated as sources and histograms of image subvolumes as mixtures. The new approach performed well on synthetic data and real magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the brain, robustly capturing intensity distributions of even small image structures and partial volume voxels.},

abstract = {Visualization and tracking of single fluorescent molecules is a recent development in optical microscopy holding great promise for the study of cell biological processes. However, all experimental strategies realized so far confined the observation to extremely thin interfacial layers. The detection and characterization of single molecules in three-dimensionally extended systems such as living cells has yet to be accomplished. We show, here, for the first time that single protein molecules can be visualized and tracked in three-dimensional (3D) samples at room temperature. Using a wide-field fluorescence microscope equipped with an Ar(+)-laser and a low-light-level CCD camera, single molecules of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) were detected in gels and viscous solutions at depths of up to approximately 10 microm from the interface. A time resolution of 5 ms was achieved by a high-speed framing mode. The two-dimensional localization accuracy was determined to be approximately 30 nm. The number of photons emitted by single GFP molecules before photodestruction was found to be < or = 4 * 10(5). Freely diffusing GFP molecules could be tracked over up to nine images acquired at a frame rate of approximately 80 Hz. From the trajectories, the diffusion coefficients of single GFP molecules were derived and found to agree well with expectation and microphotolysis measurements. Our results imply that the visualization and tracking of single molecules in living cells is possible.},

abstract = {Particle tracking techniques are often used to assess the local mechanical properties of cells and biological fluids. The extracted trajectories are exploited to compute the mean-squared displacement that characterizes the dynamics of the probe particles. Limited spatial resolution and statistical uncertainty are the limiting factors that alter the accuracy of the mean-squared displacement estimation. We precisely quantified the effect of localization errors in the determination of the mean-squared displacement by separating the sources of these errors into two separate contributions. A "static error" arises in the position measurements of immobilized particles. A "dynamic error" comes from the particle motion during the finite exposure time that is required for visualization. We calculated the propagation of these errors on the mean-squared displacement. We examined the impact of our error analysis on theoretical model fluids used in biorheology. These theoretical predictions were verified for purely viscous fluids using simulations and a multiple-particle tracking technique performed with video microscopy. We showed that the static contribution can be confidently corrected in dynamics studies by using static experiments performed at a similar noise-to-signal ratio. This groundwork allowed us to achieve higher resolution in the mean-squared displacement, and thus to increase the accuracy of microrheology studies.},

Many receptors, ion channels and cell adhesion molecules are associated with proteins important for their trafficking, surface localization or function. These complexes are embedded in a lipid environment of varying composition. Binding affinities and stoichiometry of such complexes were so far experimentally accessible only in isolated systems or monolayers of cell culture. Visualization of molecular dynamics within signalling complexes and their correlation to specialized membrane compartments demand high temporal and spatial resolution and has been difficult to demonstrate in complex tissue like brain slices. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of single-particle tracking (SPT) in organotypic brain slices to measure molecular dynamics of lipids and transmembrane proteins in correlation to synaptic membrane compartments. This method will provide important information about the dynamics and organization of surface molecules in the complex environment of neuronal networks within brain slices.},

abstract = {Epithelial folding mediated by apical constriction converts flat epithelial sheets into multilayered, complex tissue structures and is used throughout development in most animals. Little is known, however, about how forces produced near the apical surface of the tissue are transmitted within individual cells to generate the global changes in cell shape that characterize tissue deformation. Here we apply particle tracking velocimetry in gastrulating Drosophila embryos to measure the movement of cytoplasm and plasma membrane during ventral furrow formation. We find that cytoplasmic redistribution during the lengthening phase of ventral furrow formation can be precisely described by viscous flows that quantitatively match the predictions of hydrodynamics. Cell membranes move with the ambient cytoplasm, with little resistance to, or driving force on, the flow. Strikingly, apical constriction produces similar flow patterns in mutant embryos that fail to form cells before gastrulation ('acellular' embryos), such that the global redistribution of cytoplasm mirrors the summed redistribution occurring in individual cells of wild-type embryos. Our results indicate that during the lengthening phase of ventral furrow formation, hydrodynamic behaviour of the cytoplasm provides the predominant mechanism transmitting apically generated forces deep into the tissue and that cell individualization is dispensable.},

abstract = {Biofilms of various Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were grown in glass flow cells under laminar and turbulent flows. By relating the physical deformation of biofilms to variations in fluid shear, we found that the biofilms were viscoelastic fluids which behaved like elastic solids over periods of a few seconds but like linear viscous fluids over longer times. These data can be explained using concepts of associated polymeric systems, suggesting that the extracellular polymeric slime matrix determines the cohesive strength. Biofilms grown under high shear tended to form filamentous streamers while those grown under low shear formed an isotropic pattern of mound-shaped microcolonies. In some cases, sustained creep and necking in response to elevated shear resulted in a time-dependent fracture failure of the "tail" of the streamer from the attached upstream "head." In addition to structural differences, our data suggest that biofilms grown under higher shear were more strongly attached and were cohesively stronger than those grown under lower shears.},

abstract = {The development of high-throughput live cell imaging is currently limited by the capabilities of image analysis. Software is required to generate single cell time courses from large data sets of time-lapse movies and to follow properties of individual cells. Automated cell tracking faces notorious problems associated with cell division, high cell density and cell mobility. In particular, a large number of cell traces are discarded in experiments with extended observation times due to image analysis ambiguities. Here we develop an algorithm for robust tracking based on cost matrices from multiple cell parameters such as object size, position or texture. Singularities in cost indicate tracking conflicts, which can be categorized into event classes such as cell division, lysis or overlap of cells. We demonstrate that multiple parameter tracking (MPT) generates single cell fluorescence time traces more reliably than algorithms based on position tracking only. Context-sensitive automatic evaluation and event management increase the yield of continuous and correctly assigned time traces by 27\%.},

We present a model offering an improved description of the viscosity-temperature relationship for both inorganic and organic liquids using the same number of parameters as VFT and AM. The model has a clear physical foundation based on the temperature dependence of configurational entropy, and it offers an accurate prediction of low-temperature isokoms without any singularity at finite temperature.

abstract = {Parotid saliva placed in 35-mm-diameter tissue culture dishes developed increasing surface viscoelasticity at the interface with air. A surface layer became visible with time, and was collected and analysed by protein electrophoresis which indicated that a single protein (pI 4.2; molecular mass approx. 6 kDa) predominated. Western blot analysis demonstrated that the major protein band reacted with an antiserum directed against the C-terminal of the calcium-binding salivary protein statherin. Matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization-time-of-flight MS analysis gave a molecular mass of 5380 Da for the protein, corresponding to the molecular mass of statherin. Staining of film protein in electrophoresis gels was compared with statherin synthesized on a solid phase, and the mean statherin content of film formed from 1 ml of parotid saliva was measured as 7 nmol. The mean calcium content of the surface layer was 250 nmol. Surface rheology was greatly decreased in the presence of EDTA, whereas surface tension of saliva was unaffected by calcium chelation, suggesting that protein accumulated at the surface was unaffected. The results suggest that a layer rich in statherin forms at the interface of saliva and air, and that the surface rheology developed is dependent upon protein interactions mediated by calcium. The surface layer may enhance the function of saliva as a protective layer on the mucosal surfaces and teeth.},

@article{Kang2008a,
abstract = {This study focuses on how intact, hydrophobic bacteria in their stationary (i.e., non-dividing) phase could adsorb onto the hexadecane-water interface and alter its mechanical properties. The two strains of bacteria used in forming the interfacial films were Acinetobacter venetianus RAG-1 and Rhodococcus erythropolis 20S-E1-c. Using the dynamic pendant drop technique, the film interfacial tension was monitored as the surface area was made to undergo transient changes. Under static conditions, both types of bacteria had no effect on the interfacial tension. When subjected to transient excitations, however, the two bacterial films exhibited clear and qualitatively similar rheological properties: they responded as two-dimensional Maxwellian materials when the interfacial areas were dilated suddenly, but appeared to be purely elastic upon rapid area compression. Such rheological behaviours are "non-linear" in that the responses of the tension to area dilation and contraction are not mirror images of one another. Despite their qualitative similarities, the two types of film had very distinct film elasticities and relaxation times. The most striking difference between the two bacterial films was revealed under continuous reduction of area, when the A. venetianus RAG-1 system displayed a "paper-like" interface, whereas the interface of the R. erythropolis 20S-E1-c system was "soap film-like". These macroscopic observations could be explained by the surface ultrastructures of the two cell strains determined using transmission electron microscopy.},

By Beethoven’s day, the concept of “Key Character” (in which different keys conveyed specific emotional meanings), was much refined.

abstract = {One of the major environmental problems today is hydrocarbon contamination resulting from the activities related to the petrochemical industry. Accidental releases of petroleum products are of particular concern in the environment. Hydrocarbon components have been known to belong to the family of carcinogens and neurotoxic organic pollutants. Currently accepted disposal methods of incineration or burial insecure landfills can become prohibitively expensive when amounts of contaminants are large. Mechanical and chemical methods generally used to remove hydrocarbons from contaminated sites have limited effectiveness and can be expensive. Bioremediation is the promising technology for the treatment of these contaminated sites since it is cost-effective and will lead to complete mineralization. Bioremediation functions basically on biodegradation, which may refer to complete mineralization of organic contaminants into carbon dioxide, water, inorganic compounds, and cell protein or transformation of complex organic contaminants to other simpler organic compounds by biological agents like microorganisms. Many indigenous microorganisms in water and soil are capable of degrading hydrocarbon contaminants. This paper presents an updated overview of petroleum hydrocarbon degradation by microorganisms under different ecosystems.},

@article{Wierenga2006,
abstract = {The stability of adsorbed protein layers against deformation has in literature been attributed to the formation of a continuous gel-like network. This hypothesis is mostly based on measurements of the increase of the surface shear elasticity with time. For several proteins this increase has been attributed to the formation of intermolecular disulfide bridges between adsorbed proteins. However, according to an alternative model the shear elasticity results from the low mobility of the densely packed proteins. To contribute to this discussion, the actual role of disulfide bridges in interfacial layers is studied. Ovalbumin was thiolated with S-acetylmercaptosuccinic anhydride (S-AMSA), followed by removal of the acetylblock on the sulphur atom, resulting in respectively blocked (SX) and deblocked (SH) ovalbumin variants. This allows comparison of proteins with identical amino acid sequence and similar globular packing and charge distribution, but different chemical reactivity. The presence and reactivity of the introduced, deblocked sulfhydryl groups were confirmed using the sulfhydryl-disulfide exchange index (SEI). Despite the reactivity of the introduced sulfhydryl groups measured in solution, no increase in the surface shear elasticity could be detected with increasing reactivity. This indicates that physical rather than chemical interactions determine the surface shear behaviour. Further experiments were performed in bulk solution to study the conditions needed to induce covalent aggregate formation. From these studies it was found that mere concentration of proteins (to 200 mg/mL, equivalent to a surface concentration of around 2 mg/m(2)) is not sufficient to induce significant aggregation to form a continuous network. In view of these results, it was concluded that the adsorbed layer should not be considered a gelled network of aggregated material (in analogy with three-dimensional gels formed from heating protein solutions). Rather, it would appear that the adsorbed proteins form a highly packed system of proteins with net-repulsive interactions.},

abstract = {The protein hydrophobin HFBII self-assembles into very elastic films at the surface of water; these films wrinkle readily upon compression. We demonstrate and study this wrinkling instability in the context of non-planar interfaces by forming HFBII layers at the surface of bubbles whose interfaces are then compressed by deflation of the bubble. By varying the initial concentration of the hydrophobin solutions, we are able to show that buckling occurs at a critical packing fraction of protein molecules on the surface. Independent experiments show that at this packing fraction the interface has a finite positive surface tension, and not zero surface tension as is usually assumed at buckling. We attribute this non-zero wrinkling tension to the finite elasticity of these interfaces. We develop a simple geometrical model for the evolution of the wrinkle length with further deflation and show that wrinkles grow rapidly near the needle (used for deflation) towards the mid-plane of the bubble. This geometrical model yields predictions for the length of wrinkles in good agreement with experiments independently of the rheological properties of the adsorbed layer.},

abstract = {We present a method to completely characterize the viscoelasticity of Langmuir monolayers. In contrast to existing techniques, both the compression and shear moduli are determined at the same time, in a single experiment and with a standard apparatus. This approach relies on the measurement of anisotropy in the surface pressure: the tension is measured in orientations perpendicular and parallel to the compression direction. We apply this technique to the study of beta-lactoglobulin spread monolayers, a system that has been shown to develop a shear modulus at high concentration. Beta-lactoglobulin monolayers are interesting both because of their importance in food science and because they exhibit universally slow dynamical behavior that is not fully understood. Our results confirm that the compressional modulus dominates the total viscoelastic response and also provide a complex shear modulus, emerging above a critical concentration. We are able to describe how each of the dynamical response moduli is related to the surface concentration and to the equilibrium osmotic pressure.},

abstract = {We precisely measure the force-free swimming speed of a rotating helix in viscous and viscoelastic fluids. The fluids are highly viscous to replicate the low Reynolds number environment of microorganisms. The helix, a macroscopic scale model for the bacterial flagellar filament, is rigid and rotated at a constant rate while simultaneously translated along its axis. By adjusting the translation speed to make the net hydrodynamic force vanish, we measure the force-free swimming speed as a function of helix rotation rate, helix geometry, and fluid properties. We compare our measurements of the force-free swimming speed of a helix in a high-molecular weight silicone oil with predictions for the swimming speed in a Newtonian fluid, calculated using slender-body theories and a boundary-element method. The excellent agreement between theory and experiment in the Newtonian case verifies the high accuracy of our experiments. For the viscoelastic fluid, we use a polymer solution of polyisobutylene dissolved in polybutene. This solution is a Boger fluid, a viscoselastic fluid with a shear-rate-independent viscosity. The elasticity is dominated by a single relaxation time. When the relaxation time is short compared to the rotation period, the viscoelastic swimming speed is close to the viscous swimming speed. As the relaxation time increases, the viscoelastic swimming speed increases relative to the viscous speed, reaching a peak when the relaxation time is comparable to the rotation period. As the relaxation time is further increased, the viscoelastic swimming speed decreases and eventually falls below the viscous swimming speed.},

abstract = {First, different approaches to detect hydrogen bonds and to evaluate their energies are introduced newly or are extended. Supermolecular interaction energies of 256 dimers, each containing one single hydrogen bond, were correlated to various descriptors by a fit function depending both on the donor and acceptor atoms of the hydrogen bond. On the one hand, descriptors were orbital-based parameters as the two-center or three-center shared electron number, products of ionization potentials and shared electron numbers, and the natural bond orbital interaction energy. On the other hand, integral descriptors examined were the acceptor-proton distance, the hydrogen bond angle, and the IR frequency shift of the donor-proton stretching vibration. Whereas an interaction energy dependence on 1/r(3.8) was established, no correlation was found for the angle. Second, the fit functions are applied to hydrogen bonds in polypeptides, amino acid dimers, and water cluster, thus their reliability is demonstrated. Employing the fit functions to assign intramolecular hydrogen bond energies in polypeptides, several side chain CH...O and CH...N hydrogen bonds were detected on the fly. Also, the fit functions describe rather well intermolecular hydrogen bonds in amino acid dimers and the cooperativity of hydrogen bond energies in water clusters.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: In the area of peptide and protein drug products, interfaces are present as part of the basic liquid formulation, when freeze-dried formulations are reconstituted and when particulate delivery systems are prepared. Proteins are known to interact with these interfaces, and the effects seen are often irreversible adsorption and structural changes. AREAS COVERED: This review focuses on the ways in which peptides and proteins interact with surfaces and interfaces, and the effect these interactions have on the stability and safety of the active protein in pharmaceutical formulations. It illustrates, through examples, what can be determined by an adsorption study, and what can change when either the protein or the interfaces are modified. Last but not least, it addresses the value of these studies. The reader will gain an update on the basics of protein adsorption, with a focus on pharmaceutically relevant interfaces and recent advances in the field. EXPERT OPINION: Protein adsorption is widely studied; however, a more unified approach is still needed, especially on the adsorption of pharmaceutically relevant proteins, modified proteins and surfaces.},

The recent development of protein engineering has shown the limits of these techniques when applied to high throughput screening. Here we propose a microplate method to measure the activity of polysaccharide cleavage enzymes through small variations in viscosity. Polysaccharide solutions are co-incubated with magnetic particles in enzyme buffers. The cleavage action of polymer-degrading enzymes increases the mobility of the particles in a magnetic field, even at low levels of enzyme activities. This reproducible, sensitive technique was used to evaluate enzymatic specificity towards substrates. BioFilm indices (BFI) determined by associated software were used to follow enzyme kinetics and measure the usual variables.},

abstract = {Hexadecane assimilation by Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus SP17 occurs through the formation of a biofilm at the alkane-water interface. In this study we focused on the interactions of cells with the alkane-water interface occurring during initiation of biofilm development. The behavior of cells at the interface was apprehended by investigating alterations of the mechanical properties of the interface during cell adsorption, using dynamic drop tensiometry measurements. It was found that after having reached the hexadecane-water interface, by a purely thermal diffusion process, cells released surface-active compounds (SACs) resulting in the formation of an interfacial visco-elastic film. Release of SACs was an active process requiring protein synthesis. This initial interaction occurred on metabolizable as well as non-metabolizable alkanes, indicating that at this stage cells are not affected by the nature of the alkane forming the interface. In contrast, at a later stage, the nature of the interface turned out to exert control over the behavior of the cells. The availability of a metabolizable alkane at the interface influenced cell activity, as revealed by cell cluster formation and differences in the interfacial elasticity.},

The method is based on a polynomial fit of the intensity around each feature point, weighted by a Gaussian function of the distance from the centre, and is especially suitable for tracking endogeneous particles in the cell, imaged with bright field, phase contrast or fluorescence optical microscopy. Furthermore, the method can simultaneously track particles of all different sizes, and allows significant freedom in their shape. The algorithm is evaluated using the quantitative measures of accuracy and precision of previous authors, using simulated images at variable signal-to-noise ratios. To these we add new tests: the error due to a non-uniform background, and the error due to two particles approaching each other. Finally the tracking of particles in real cell images is demonstrated. The method is made freely available for non-commercial use as a software package with a graphical user-interface, which can be run within the Matlab programming environment.},

abstract = {The long-time correlation functions of an infinitesimally thin needle moving through stationary point scatterers-a so-called Lorentz model-exhibits surprisingly long-time tails. These long-time tails are now seen to persist in a two-dimensional model even when the needle has a finite thickness. If the needles are too thick, then the needles are effectively trapped at all nontrivial densities of the scatterers. At needle widths approximately equal to or smaller than sigma = epsilon/20 where $\epsilon$ is the average spacing between scatterers, the needle diffuses and exhibits the crossover transition from the expected Enskog behavior to the enhanced translation diffusion seen earlier by H\"{o}fling, Frey and Franosch [ Phys. Rev. Lett. 2008 , 101 , 120605 ]. At this needle width, an increase in its center-of-mass diffusion with respect to increasing density is seen after a crossover density of n* approximately 5 is reached. (The reduced density n* is defined as n* = nL(2) where n is the number density of particles and L is the needle length.) The crossover transition for needles with finite thickness is spread over a range of densities exhibiting intermediate behavior. The asymptotic divergence of the center of mass diffusion is suppressed compared to that of infinitely thin needles. Finally, a new diminished diffusion regime, apparently due to the increased importance of head-on collisions, now appears at high scattering densities.},

It occurs by the extension, tethering, and then retraction of polar type IV pili, which operate in a manner similar to a grappling hook. Twitching motility is equivalent to social gliding motility in Myxococcus xanthus and is important in host colonization by a wide range of plant and animal pathogens, as well as in the formation of biofilms and fruiting bodies. The biogenesis and function of type IV pili is controlled by a large number of genes, almost 40 of which have been identified in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A number of genes required for pili assembly are homologous to genes involved in type II protein secretion and competence for DNA uptake, suggesting that these systems share a common architecture. Twitching motility is also controlled by a range of signal transduction systems, including two-component sensor-regulators and a complex chemosensory system.},

abstract = {The interactions and coordination of biomolecules are crucial for most cellular functions. The observation of protein interactions in live cells may provide a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms. After fluorescent labeling of the interacting partners and live-cell microscopy, the colocalization is generally analyzed by quantitative global methods. Recent studies have addressed questions regarding the individual colocalization of moving biomolecules, usually by using single-particle tracking (SPT) and comparing the fluorescent intensities in both color channels. Here, we introduce a new method that combines SPT and correlation methods to obtain a dynamical 3D colocalization analysis along single trajectories of dual-colored particles. After 3D tracking, the colocalization is computed at each particle's position via the local 3D image cross correlation of the two detection channels. For every particle analyzed, the output consists of the 3D trajectory, the time-resolved 3D colocalization information, and the fluorescence intensity in both channels. In addition, the cross-correlation analysis shows the 3D relative movement of the two fluorescent labels with an accuracy of 30 nm. We apply this method to the tracking of viral fusion events in live cells and demonstrate its capacity to obtain the time-resolved colocalization status of single particles in dense and noisy environments.},

abstract = {Particle tracking is a widely used and promising technique for elucidating complex dynamics of the living cell. The cytoplasm is an active material, in which the kinetics of intracellular structures are highly heterogeneous. Tracer particles typically undergo a combination of random motion and various types of directed motion caused by the activity of molecular motors and other non-equilibrium processes. Random switching between more and less directional persistence of motion generally occurs. We present a method for identifying states of motion with different directional persistence in individual particle trajectories. Our analysis is based on a multi-scale turning angle model to characterize motion locally, together with a Hidden Markov Model with two states representing different directional persistence. We define one of the states by the motion of particles in a reference data set where some active processes have been inhibited. We illustrate the usefulness of the method by studying transport of vesicles along microtubules and transport of nanospheres activated by myosin. We study the results using mean square displacements, durations, and particle speeds within each state. We conclude that the method provides accurate identification of states of motion with different directional persistence, with very good agreement in terms of mean-squared displacement between the reference data set and one of the states in the two-state model.},

abstract = {Understanding complex cellular processes requires investigating the underlying mechanisms within a spatiotemporal context. Although cellular processes are dynamic in nature, most studies in molecular cell biology are based on fixed specimens, for example, using immunocytochemistry or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). However, breakthroughs in fluorescence microscopy imaging techniques, in particular, the discovery of green fluorescent protein (GFP) and its spectral variants, have facilitated the study of a wide range of dynamic processes by allowing nondestructive labeling of target structures in living cells. In addition, the tremendous improvements in spatial and temporal resolution of light microscopes now allow cellular processes to be analyzed in unprecedented detail. These state-of-the-art imaging technologies, however, provide a huge amount of digital image data. To cope with the enormous amount of image data and to extract reproducible as well as quantitative information, computer-based image analysis is required. In this article, we describe methods for computer-based analysis of multidimensional live cell microscopy images and their application to study the dynamics of cells and particles. First, we sketch a general workflow for quantitative analysis of live cell images. Then, we detail computational methods for automatic image analysis comprising image preprocessing, segmentation, registration, tracking, and classification. We conclude with a discussion of quantitative analysis and systems biology.},

The oil sands provide a unique environment for bacteria as a result of the stressors of low water availability and high hydrocarbon concentrations. Understanding the mechanisms bacteria use to tolerate these stresses may aid in our understanding of how hydrocarbon degradation has occurred over geological time, and how these processes and related tolerance mechanisms may be used in biotechnology applications such as microbial enhanced oil recovery (MEOR). The majority of research has focused on microbiology processes in oil reservoirs and oilfields; as such there is a paucity of information specific to oil sands. By studying microbial processes in oil sands there is the potential to use microbes in MEOR applications.

abstract = {Cell mechanical properties play an important role in determining many cellular activities. Passive microrheology techniques, such as Multiple-Particle-Tracking (MPT) give an insight into the structural rearrangements and viscoelastic response of a wide range of materials, in particular soft materials and complex fluids like cell cytoplasm in living cells. The technique finds an important field of application in large cells such as oocytes where, during their growth, several organelles and molecules are displaced in specific territories of the cell instrumental for later embryonic development. To measure cell mechanics, cells are usually deformed by many techniques that are slow and often invasive. To overcome these limits, the MPT technique is applied. Probe particles are embedded in the viscoelastic sample and their properties are extracted from the thermal fluctuation spectra measured using digital video-microscopy. The Brownian motion of a probe particle immersed in a network is directly related to the network's mechanical properties. Particles exhibit larger motions when their local environments are less rigid or less viscous. The mean-square-displacement (MSD) of the particle's trajectory is used to quantify its amplitude of motions over different time scales.},

The line tension between the liquid expanded and the gaseous phase on the other hand is of similar magnitude for both fluorinated and non-fluorinated surfactants. The difference of fluorinated versus non-fluorinated monolayers is measured by active microrheology and by observing the shape relaxation of distorted liquid expanded domains toward a circular shape. Our microrheology measurements are supported by measurements of the relaxation rates of distortions, which in fluorinated liquid expanded phases are proportional to the deviation of the curvature from the mean curvature, whereas they are proportional to the square of the deviation of the curvature from the mean curvature in non-fluorinated monolayers.},

The interplay between the two strands operates at many scales: themes which have already benefited from it include the possible role of mantle plumes in the breakup of Gondwana, the Cenozoic development of drainage systems in Africa and Australia, Himalayan uplift in response to erosion, alternating episodes of uplift and subsidence in the Mississippi delta, buckling of the Indian lithospheric plate, and changes in stream pattern and sinuosity along individual alluvial channels subject to localized deformation. Developments in remote sensing, isotopic dating and numerical modelling are starting to yield quantitative analyses of such effects, to the benefit of geodymamics as well as fluvial hydrology.},

However, this approximation has a restricted validity range, and its application to determination of inclusion sizes from diffusion data may in certain cases lead to unreliable results. At the same time, the model by Hughes et al. (Hughes, B. D., B. A. Pailthorpe, and C. R. White. 1981. J. Fluid Mech. 110:349-372.), providing diffusion coefficients of membrane inclusions for arbitrary inclusion sizes and viscosities of the membrane and surrounding fluids, involves substantial computational efforts, which prevents its use in practical data analysis. We develop a simple and accurate analytical approximation to the Hughes et al. model and demonstrate its performance and utility by applying it to the recently published experimental data on translational diffusion of micrometer-sized membrane domains.},

abstract = {Prevailing opinion suggests that only substances up to 64 nm in diameter can move at appreciable rates through the brain extracellular space (ECS). This size range is large enough to allow diffusion of signaling molecules, nutrients, and metabolic waste products, but too small to allow efficient penetration of most particulate drug delivery systems and viruses carrying therapeutic genes, thereby limiting effectiveness of many potential therapies. We analyzed the movements of nanoparticles of various diameters and surface coatings within fresh human and rat brain tissue ex vivo and mouse brain in vivo. Nanoparticles as large as 114 nm in diameter diffused within the human and rat brain, but only if they were densely coated with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). Using these minimally adhesive PEG-coated particles, we estimated that human brain tissue ECS has some pores larger than 200 nm and that more than one-quarter of all pores are ≥ 100 nm. These findings were confirmed in vivo in mice, where 40- and 100-nm, but not 200-nm, nanoparticles spread rapidly within brain tissue, only if densely coated with PEG. Similar results were observed in rat brain tissue with paclitaxel-loaded biodegradable nanoparticles of similar size (85 nm) and surface properties. The ability to achieve brain penetration with larger nanoparticles is expected to allow more uniform, longer-lasting, and effective delivery of drugs within the brain, and may find use in the treatment of brain tumors, stroke, neuroinflammation, and other brain diseases where the blood-brain barrier is compromised or where local delivery strategies are feasible.},

Live-cell imaging experiments carried out to this end often produce massive amounts of time-lapse image data containing far more information than can be digested by a human observer. Computerized image analysis offers the potential to take full advantage of available data in an efficient and reproducible manner. A recurring task in many experiments is the tracking of large numbers of cells or particles and the analysis of their (morpho)dynamic behavior. In the past decade, many methods have been developed for this purpose, and software tools based on these are increasingly becoming available. Here, we survey the latest developments in this area and discuss the various computational approaches, software tools, and quantitative measures for tracking and motion analysis of cells and particles in time-lapse microscopy images.},

abstract = {Obtaining sub-resolution particle positions in fluorescence microscopy images is essential for single particle tracking and high-resolution localization microscopy. While the localization precision of stationary single molecules or particles is well understood, the influence of particle motion during image acquisition has been largely neglected. Here, we address this issue and provide a theoretical description on how particle motion influences the centroid localization precision, both in case of 2-D and 3-D diffusion. In addition, a novel method is proposed, based on dual-channel imaging, for the experimental determination of the localization precision of moving particles. For typical single particle tracking experiments, we show that the localization precision is approximately two-fold worse than expected from the stationary theory. Strikingly, we find that the most popular localization method, based on the fitting of a Gaussian distribution, breaks down for lateral diffusion. Instead, the centroid localization method is found to perform well under all conditions.},

abstract = {The organization and dynamics of proteins are fundamental parameters for cellular function. Their study, at the single-molecule level, provides precise information on molecular interactions. Over the last 30 years, the single-particle tracking imaging technique has proven its capability to efficiently quantify such parameters in many biological systems, with nanometric accuracy and millisecond temporal resolutions. Nevertheless, the low concentration of labeling required for single-molecule imaging usually prevents the extraction of large statistics. The advent of high-density single-molecule-based super-resolution techniques has revolutionized the field, allowing monitoring of thousands of biomolecules in the minute timescale and providing unprecedented insight into the molecular organization and dynamics of cellular compounds. In this issue, I will review the main principles of single-particle tracking, a highly interdisciplinary technique at the interface between microscopy, image analysis and labeling strategies. I will point out the advantages brought by high-density single-particle tracking which will be illustrated with a few recent biological results.},

@article{Be'er2011b,
abstract = {Swarming bacteria move on agar surfaces in groups, using flagella as motive organelles. Motility depends critically on surface wetness, which is enabled by osmotic agents and surfactants secreted by the bacteria. In a recent study, the upper surface of an Escherichia coli swarm was found to be stationary, as determined from the motion of MgO particles deposited on the swarm. This led to the remarkable conclusion that the bacteria move between two stationary surfaces-the agar gel below and the liquid/air interface above. That study suggested that secreted surfactants may contribute to immobilizing the upper surface of a swarm. Here, we test this proposition using two robust surfactant-producing bacteria. We find antithetically that the upper surfaces of both these swarms are mobile, showing a superdiffusive behavior in swarms with stronger surfactant activity. Superdiffusive behavior was not observed on the surface of a drop of bacterial culture, on bacteria-free culture supernatant, or on nonswarming surfactant-producer colonies, which suggests that superdiffusion is an emergent property resulting from the interaction of the collective motion of the bacteria within the swarm with the surfactant layer above. Swarming not only allows bacteria to forage for food, but also confers protective advantages against antimicrobial agents. Our results are therefore relevant to superdiffusive strategies in biological foraging and survival.},

@article{Azartash2011,
abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this work was to gather preliminary data in normals and dry eye subjects, using a new, non-invasive imaging platform to measure the thickness of pre-corneal tear film.

METHODS: Human subjects were screened for dry eye and classified as dry or normal. Tear film thickness over the inferior paracentral cornea was measured using laser illumination and a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) camera. A previously developed mathematical model was used to calculate the thickness of the tear film by applying the principle of spatial auto-correlation function (ACF).

RESULTS: Mean tear film thickness values (±SD) were 3.05 $\mu$m (0.20) and 2.48 $\mu$m (0.32) on the initial visit for normals (n=18) and dry eye subjects (n=22), respectively, and were significantly different (p<0.001, 2-sample t-test). Repeatability was good between visit 1 and 2 for normals (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]=0.935) and dry eye subjects (ICC=0.950). Tear film thickness increased above baseline for the dry eye subjects following viscous drop instillation and remained significantly elevated for up to approximately 32 min (n=20; p<0.05 until 32 min; general linear mixed model and Dunnett's tests).

CONCLUSIONS: This technique for imaging the ocular surface appears to provide tear thickness values in agreement with other non-invasive methods. Moreover, the technique can differentiate between normal and dry eye patient types.},

abstract = {Super-resolution localization microscopy methods provide powerful new capabilities for probing biology at the nanometer scale via fluorescence. These methods rely on two key innovations: switchable fluorophores (which blink on and off and can be sequentially imaged) and powerful localization algorithms (which estimate the positions of the fluorophores in the images). These techniques have spurred a flurry of innovation in algorithm development over the last several years. In this Review, we survey the fundamental issues for single-fluorophore fitting routines, localization algorithms based on principles other than fitting, three-dimensional imaging, dipole imaging and techniques for estimating fluorophore positions from images of multiple activated fluorophores. We offer practical advice for users and adopters of algorithms, and we identify areas for further development.},

abstract = {Kinesin is a processive motor that takes 8.3-nm center-of-mass steps along microtubules for each adenosine triphosphate hydrolyzed. Whether kinesin moves by a "hand-over-hand" or an "inchworm" model has been controversial. We have labeled a single head of the kinesin dimer with a Cy3 fluorophore and localized the position of the dye to within 2 nm before and after a step. We observed that single kinesin heads take steps of 17.3 +/- 3.3 nm. A kinetic analysis of the dwell times between steps shows that the 17-nm steps alternate with 0-nm steps. These results strongly support a hand-over-hand mechanism, and not an inchworm mechanism. In addition, our results suggest that kinesin is bound by both heads to the microtubule while it waits for adenosine triphosphate in between steps.},

abstract = {The motion of peritrichously flagellated bacteria close to surfaces is relevant to understanding the early stages of biofilm formation and of pathogenic infection. This motion differs from the random-walk trajectories of cells in free solution. Individual Escherichia coli cells swim in clockwise, circular trajectories near planar glass surfaces. On a semi-solid agar substrate, cells differentiate into an elongated, hyperflagellated phenotype and migrate cooperatively over the surface, a phenomenon called swarming. We have developed a technique for observing isolated E. coli swarmer cells moving on an agar substrate and confined in shallow, oxidized poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) microchannels. Here we show that cells in these microchannels preferentially 'drive on the right', swimming preferentially along the right wall of the microchannel (viewed from behind the moving cell, with the agar on the bottom). We propose that when cells are confined between two interfaces--one an agar gel and the second PDMS--they swim closer to the agar surface than to the PDMS surface (and for much longer periods of time), leading to the preferential movement on the right of the microchannel. Thus, the choice of materials guides the motion of cells in microchannels.},

abstract = {Our understanding of the phylogenetic diversity, metabolic capabilities, ecological roles, and community dynamics of oil reservoir microbial communities is far from complete. The lack of appreciation of the microbiology of oil reservoirs can lead to detrimental consequences such as souring or plugging. In contrast, knowledge of the microbiology of oil reservoirs can be used to enhance productivity and recovery efficiency. It is clear that (1) nitrate and/or nitrite addition controls H2S production, (2) oxygen injection stimulates hydrocarbon metabolism and helps mobilize crude oil, (3) injection of fermentative bacteria and carbohydrates generates large amounts of acids, gases, and solvents that increases oil recovery particularly in carbonate formations, and (4) nutrient injection stimulates microbial growth preferentially in high permeability zones and improves volumetric sweep efficiency and oil recovery. Biosurfactants significantly lower the interfacial tension between oil and water and large amounts of biosurfactant can be made in situ. However, it is still uncertain whether in situ biosurfactant production can be induced on the scale needed for economic oil recovery. Commercial microbial paraffin control technologies slow the rate of decline in oil production and extend the operational life of marginal oil fields. Microbial technologies are often applied in marginal fields where the risk of implementation is low. However, more quantitative assessments of the efficacy of microbial oil recovery will be needed before microbial oil recovery gains widespread acceptance.},

The 2D nature of interfaces present unique challenges and opportunities: coupling between the 2D films and the bulk fluids complicates the measurement of surface dynamic properties, but allows the interfacial microstructure to be directly visualized during deformation. Here we present a novel technique that combines active microrheology with fluorescence microscopy to visualize fluid interfaces as they deform under applied stress, allowing structure and rheology to be correlated on the micron-scale in monolayer films. We show that even simple, single-component lipid monolayers can exhibit viscoelasticity, history dependence, a yield stress and hours-long time scales for elastic recoil and aging. Simultaneous visualization of the monolayer under stress shows that the rich dynamical response results from the cooperative dynamics and deformation of liquid-crystalline domains and their boundaries.},

abstract = {The role of quorum sensing in Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm formation is unclear. Some researchers have shown that quorum sensing is important for biofilm development, while others have indicated it has little or no role. In this study, the contribution of quorum sensing to biofilm development was found to depend upon the nutritional environment. Depending upon the carbon source, quorum-sensing mutant strains (lasIrhlI and lasRrhlR) either exhibited a pronounced defect early in biofilm formation or formed biofilms identical to the wild-type strain. Quorum sensing was then shown to exert its nutritionally conditional control of biofilm development through regulation of swarming motility. Examination of pilA and fliM mutant strains further supported the role of swarming motility in biofilm formation. These data led to a model proposing that the prevailing nutritional conditions dictate the contributions of quorum sensing and swarming motility at a key juncture early in biofilm development.},

abstract = {Characterisation of multi-protein interactions in cellular networks can be achieved by optical microscopy using multidimensional single molecule fluorescence imaging. Proteins of different species, individually labelled with a single fluorophore, can be imaged as isolated spots (features) of different colour light in different channels, and their diffusive behaviour in cells directly measured through time. Challenges in data analysis have, however, thus far hindered its application in biology. A set of methods for the automated analysis of multidimensional single molecule microscopy data from cells is presented, incorporating Bayesian segmentation-based feature detection, image registration and particle tracking. Single molecules of different colours can be simultaneously detected in noisy, high background data with an arbitrary number of channels, acquired simultaneously or time-multiplexed, and then tracked through time. The resulting traces can be further analysed, for example to detect intensity steps, count discrete intensity levels, measure fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) or changes in polarisation. Examples are shown illustrating the use of the algorithms in investigations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signalling network, a key target for cancer therapeutics, and with simulated data.},

The step size alternates between 37 + 2x nm and 37 - 2x, where x is the distance along the direction of motion between the dye and the midpoint between the two heads. These results strongly support a hand-over-hand model of motility, not an inchworm model.},

abstract = {Glasses are disordered materials that lack the periodicity of crystals but behave mechanically like solids. The most common way of making a glass is by cooling a viscous liquid fast enough to avoid crystallization. Although this route to the vitreous state-supercooling-has been known for millennia, the molecular processes by which liquids acquire amorphous rigidity upon cooling are not fully understood. Here we discuss current theoretical knowledge of the manner in which intermolecular forces give rise to complex behaviour in supercooled liquids and glasses. An intriguing aspect of this behaviour is the apparent connection between dynamics and thermodynamics. The multidimensional potential energy surface as a function of particle coordinates (the energy landscape) offers a convenient viewpoint for the analysis and interpretation of supercooling and glass-formation phenomena. That much of this analysis is at present largely qualitative reflects the fact that precise computations of how viscous liquids sample their landscape have become possible only recently.},

@article{Bird2010,
abstract = {Thin liquid films, such as soap bubbles, have been studied extensively for over a century because they are easily formed and mediate a wide range of transport processes in physics, chemistry and engineering. When a bubble on a liquid-gas or solid-gas interface (referred to herein as an interfacial bubble) ruptures, the general expectation is that the bubble vanishes. More precisely, the ruptured thin film is expected to retract rapidly until it becomes part of the interface, an event that typically occurs within milliseconds. The assumption that ruptured bubbles vanish is central to theories on foam evolution and relevant to health and climate because bubble rupture is a source for aerosol droplets. Here we show that for a large range of fluid parameters, interfacial bubbles can create numerous small bubbles when they rupture, rather than vanishing. We demonstrate, both experimentally and numerically, that the curved film of the ruptured bubble can fold and entrap air as it retracts. The resulting toroidal geometry of the trapped air is unstable, leading to the creation of a ring of smaller bubbles. The higher pressure associated with the higher curvature of the smaller bubbles increases the absorption of gas into the liquid, and increases the efficiency of rupture-induced aerosol dispersal.},

abstract = {External reflection FTIR spectroscopy and surface pressure measurements were used to compare conformational changes in the adsorbed structures of three globular proteins at the air/water interface. Of the three proteins studied, lysozyme, bovine serum albumin and beta-lactoglobulin, lysozyme was unique in its behaviour. Lysozyme adsorption was slow, taking approximately 2.5 h to reach a surface pressure plateau (from a 0.07 mM solution), and led to significant structural change. The FTIR spectra revealed that lysozyme formed a highly networked adsorbed layer of unfolded protein with high antiparallel beta-sheet content and that these changes occurred rapidly (within 10 min). This non-native secondary structure is analogous to that of a 3D heat-set protein gel, suggesting that the adsorbed protein formed a highly networked interfacial layer. Albumin and beta-lactoglobulin adsorbed rapidly (reaching a plateau within 10 min) and with little change to their native secondary structure.},
