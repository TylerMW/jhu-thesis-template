\section{Trackpy Documentation}

\noindent Dear Thesis Readers:

The particle-tracking and data analysis code presented in Chapter \ref{chap:trackpy} is documented online with tutorials and examples, both from my own work and contributed by other researchers from their work. In printed form, this documentation fills over 50 single-spaced pages and is too detailed to be of interest in the context of this reading. I will ultimately include it in this appendix for archival, but for now I refer you to the online copy at http://soft-matter.github.io/trackpy.
