\section{Trackpy Documentation}

\noindent Dear Thesis Readers:

The particle-tracking and data analysis code presented in Chapter \ref{chap:trackpy} is thoroughly documented online with a tutorial and with examples contributed from my own work and examples contributed by other researchers at other universities who have used trackpy in their work.

In printed form, this documentation fills over 50 single-spaced pages and is too detailed to be of interest in the context of this reading. I will ultimately include it in this appendix for archival, but today I refer you to the online copy at http://soft-matter.github.io/trackpy.
